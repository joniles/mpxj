# MPXJ
Welcome to MPXJ! This library enables you to read project plans (sometimes known
as schedules or programmes) from a variety of file formats and databases, and
can also write that information to a variety of file formats.

The library is based on data structures which follow the way
schedule data is represented by Microsoft Project, extended to accommodate
features and concepts from other applications.

## Sponsors
Work to build and maintain MPXJ is kindly supported by my sponsors:

## File Formats
MPXJ can read file formats including MPX, MPP, MSPDI, MPD, Planner, Primavera
P6, Primavera P3, SureTrak, Asta Powerproject, Asta Easyplan, Phoenix,
Fasttrack, GanttProject, TurboProject, ConceptDraw PROJECT, Synchro, Gantt
Designer, SDEF, Sage 100 Contractor Schedule Grid and Project Commander.

MPXJ can also write schedule data as MPX, MSPDI, PMXML, Planner and SDEF files.

More details of the supported file formats can be found
[here](https://www.mpxj.org/supported-formats/).


## Languages
MPXJ is written and maintained in Java, however this is no barrier to using
its functionality in other languages. Thanks to [IKVM](https://github.com/ikvm-revived/ikvm), MPXJ is
[available for .Net](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=net.sf.mpxj), allowing it to be used from any .Net language.

There is also now a [Ruby Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/mpxj) which provides
native Ruby access to read from schedule files using MPXJ, and a
[Python package](https://pypi.org/project/mpxj/) which wraps the Java library to
provide full read/write access to schedule files.

You may be able to leverage MPXJ from other languages too, for example the 
[PHP/Java Bridge](http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net)
can be used to expose the complete MPXJ API in PHP.

## Contact

Using MPXJ successfully somewhere? I'd
[love to hear from you](mailto:jon.iles@bcs.org.uk) about your experiences.
Do tell me what's missing or what could be better - I can use this feedback
to guide future development work. It would also be great to add a link to your
website from the [MPXJ users page](https://www.mpxj.org/users/).
