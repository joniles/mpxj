<section name="Introduction">

<p>Welcome to MPXJ! This library provides a set of facilities to
allow project information to be manipulated in Java and .Net. MPXJ supports
five file formats, Microsoft Project Exchange (MPX), Microsoft
Project (MPP,MPT), Microsoft Project Data Interchange (MSPDI XML), Microsoft 
Project Database (MPD), and Planner (XML).</p>

<p>The library is currently based around a set of data structures
modelled on the data described by the MPP file format. All
manipulation of project data takes place using these data
structures, which can be read from or written to the various
supported file formats. The notes in the following paragraphs explain the
facilities MPXJ offers for each file format.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>MPX:</b> The MPX file format can be read by all versions of Microsoft
Project, and written by all versions up to Microsoft Project 98.
MPXJ allows MPX files to be created, read and written. See
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q270139" target="_blank">
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q270139</a> 
for a definition of the file format.</li>

<li><b>MPP:</b> The MPP file format is Microsoft's proprietary way of storing
project data. MPXJ supports read only access to MPP files produced
by Microsoft Project 98, Microsoft Project 2000, Microsoft 
Project 2002, Microsoft Project 2003, and Microsoft Project 2007.
MPP template files, with the suffix MPT are also supported.</li>

<li><b>MSPDI:</b> The MSPDI file format is Microsoft's XML file format for
storing project data. Microsoft Project 2002, Microsoft Project
2003 and Microsoft Project 2007 can read and write MSPDI files. 
MPXJ allows MSPDI files to be created, read, and written. Documentation on the 
Project 2003 MSPDI file format can be 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=FE118952-3547-420A-A412-00A2662442D9" target="_blank">
downloaded from the MSDN web site</a> as part of the Office 2003 
XML Reference Schemas package. The equivalent documentation for Project 2007
can also be 
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb428843.aspx" target="_blank">
downloaded from the MSDN web site</a> as part of the 
Microsoft Office Project 2007 SDK.
</li>

<li><b>MPD:</b> The MPD file format is an Access database file format used to
store one or more projects. The database schema used in these databases is 
also close to that used by Microsoft Project Server. MPXJ can read projects
stored in an MPD file using a JDBC connection. It is possible that MPXJ could 
also read the same data from a Microsoft Project Server database using the
same approach - but I haven't tried this!</li>

<li><b>PLANNER:</b> Planner is an Open Source project management too which uses
an XML file format to store project data. MPXJ read and write the Planner
file format.</li>
</ul>

<section name="Java and .Net">
<p>MPXJ is written and maintained in Java, however this is no barrier to
using its functionality in .Net applications. Thanks to the facilities 
provided by IKVM, the MPXJ distribution also contains a native .Net DLL version
of MPXJ and its library dependencies. This allows MPXJ to be used 
from any .Net programming language (for example, C#, Visual Basic 
and so on), without having to be aware that the original code was written 
in Java. As part of the MPXJ release process the Java and .Net libraries
are both exercised using the same set of regression tests to ensure that their
behaviour is identical. Both the Java and .Net versions of the library
are used in production commercial applications - so you can confident
that the code will work for you!</p>

<section name="Getting started with MPXJ in Java">

<p>The latest release of MPXJ can be downloaded from the project's
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=70649">SourceForge download page</a>.
The core MPXJ functionality is contained in the mpxj.jar file, which you
will find in the root folder of the MPXJ distribution.
The library is simple to use, and to illustrate this, a
small number of sample files have been included in the utility
source package of the distribution.</p>

<p>The MPP functionality depends on the 
<a href="http://poi.apache.org/" target="_blank">POI</a> library.
In order to use the MPP functionality in MPXJ, the
POI JAR file must be present on your classpath. A copy of this
library can be found in the lib directory of the MPXJ distribution.</p>

<p>The MSPDI functionality depends on the 
<a href="https://jaxb.dev.java.net/" target="_blank">Sun JAXB reference implementation</a>.
In order to use the MSPDI functionality the JAXB JAR files must be present 
on your classpath. Copies of the relevant libraries can be found in the lib 
directory of the MPXJ distribution.</p>

The core MPXJ functionality is contained in the mpxj.dll file, which you
will find in the lib.net folder of the MPXJ distribution. To use the library
you will also need to ensure that the IKVM runtime DLLs are in visible to .Net.
These are also provided in the lib.net folder of the MPXJ distribution.</p>

<section name="Keep in touch">

<p>We're keen to hear from you about how you are using MPXJ,
please 
<a href="mailto:jon.iles@bcs.org.uk">drop me a note</a>. 
If you use MPXJ as a part of an application that you redistribute,
commercially or otherwise, drop us a line and we'll include
a link to your website on the MPXJ page</p>
</section>


<section name="You can help us">
<p>Please let us know what features you'd like to see added
to MPXJ. In addition, the MPP functionality is not
complete as we have had to reverse engineer the data from
the MPP file format, so we need to know if you have MPP
files that can't be read, or don't contain the data you
expect. The more of this feedback you can give us, the
better we can make MPXJ!</p>
