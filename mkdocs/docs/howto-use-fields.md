# How To: Use Fields
Once you've read a schedule using MPXJ, and you have a `ProjectFile` instance
with tasks, resources and resource assignments, how do you access the data
represented by the fields provided by each of these entities? If you're
creating or updating a schedule, how can you assign values to fields? This
section explains the different approaches you can take in each of these cases.

## Setter and Getter Methods
Let's start by creating a task we can use to demonstrate some of these
approaches:

```java
ProjectFile file = new ProjectFile();
Task task = file.addTask();
```

When you already know exactly which field you need to access, you can work with 
the data these fields contain in a type-safe way by using the setter and getter
methods provided by each class, for example:

```java
task.setName("Task 1");

String name = task.getName();
System.out.println("Task name: " + name);
```

Here's the output from the sample code:

```
Task name: Task 1
```

Here we can see that we are able to set the name of the task using a `String`,
and when we call the getter method we'll be returned the name as a `String`.
How about working with a field that has a type other than a String?

```java
DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy");
Date startDate = df.parse("10/05/2022");
task.setStart(startDate);

System.out.println("Start date: " + df.format(task.getStart()));
```

Here's the output from the sample code:

```
Start date: 10/05/2022
```

We're setting and retrieving the task's start date using a `Date` instance.
For almost all of the fields supported by tasks, resources, and resource
assignments you'll find a pair of getter and setter methods allowing you
to access and modify the field with a convenient type safe interface.

## Field Enumerations
What if we don't know ahead of time which fields we need to access? For example,
what if our application allows users to chose which fields to display for
each task? In this case we can use a data-driven approach to read and write
fields, as shown in the example below.

```java
task = file.addTask();
task.set(TaskField.NAME, "Task 2");

name = (String)task.get(TaskField.NAME);
System.out.println("Task name: " + name);

startDate = df.parse("11/05/2022");
task.set(TaskField.START, startDate);

System.out.println("Start date: " + df.format(task.getStart()));
```

Here's the output from this sample code:

```
Task name: Task 2
Start date: 11/05/2022
```

What are the `TaskField` values in the example above? `TaskField` is an
enumeration representing all of the fields of a `Task` instance. This type of
enumeration is not unique to tasks, there are four main enumerations
available:

* `ProjectField`: fields available from `ProjectProperties`
* `ResourceField`: fields available from a `Resource` 
* `TaskField`: fields available from a `Task`
* `AssignmentField`: fields available from a `ResourceAssignment`

The `ProjectProperties`, `Resource`, `Task` and `ResourceAssignment` classes
noted above actually all implement the `FieldContainer` interface. This is the
interface that gives us the `get` and `set` methods we've seen in the examples
above. `FieldContainer` also provides us with one more interesting method:
`getCachedValue`. What is this, and why is it different to the `get` method?
Let's take a step back and look at calculated values to understand where
`getCachedValue` fits in.

## Calculated Fields
Some of the fields available from each of these classes can actually contain a
calculated value. For example: the `Task` field "Start Variance" represents the
difference between the Baseline Start date and the Start date of a task. Some
schedules may provide this value for us when we read the data they contain,
others may not. If we don't have this value when we read our schedule data, but
we do have a Baseline Start and Start date available to us, then we can perform
the calculation ourselves to produce the Start Variance value. The example
below illustrates this:

```java
// Set up the sample project
ProjectFile file = new ProjectFile();

// We need at least a default calendar to calculate variance
file.setDefaultCalendar(file.addDefaultBaseCalendar());

// Create tasks
Task task1 = file.addTask();
Task task2 = file.addTask();

// Set up example dates
DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy");
Date baselineStart = df.parse("01/05/2022");
Date startDate = df.parse("10/05/2022");

// Update task1 using methods
task1.setStart(startDate);
task1.setBaselineStart(baselineStart);

// Update task2 using TaskField enumeration
task2.set(TaskField.START, startDate);
task2.set(TaskField.BASELINE_START, baselineStart);

// Show the variance being retrieved by method and TaskField enumeration
System.out.println("Task 1");
System.out.println("Start Variance from method: "
   + task1.getStartVariance());
System.out.println("Start Variance from get: "
   + task1.get(TaskField.START_VARIANCE));
System.out.println();

System.out.println("Task 2");
System.out.println("Start Variance from method: "
   + task2.getStartVariance());
System.out.println("Start Variance from get: "
   + task2.get(TaskField.START_VARIANCE));
```

Here's the output from running this code:

```
Task 1
Start Variance from method: 6.0d
Start Variance from get: 6.0d

Task 2
Start Variance from method: 6.0d
Start Variance from get: 6.0d
```

Regardless of how we set up the data, both the `getStartVariance` method and the
call to `get(TaskField.START_VARIANCE)` trigger the calculation and produce the
expected Start Variance value.

Rather than immediately discarding the Start Variance value we've just
calculated, this value is cached as part of the data held by the task, and will
be returned next time we use the `getStartVariance` method or we call
`get(TaskField.START_VARIANCE)`.


## Cached Values
The `getCachedValue` method allows us to retrieve a field _without attempting to
calculate a value_. It's not a method you'd normally expect to use, but it's
worth mentioning for completeness. Let's take a look at this using a new
example:

```java
// Set up the sample project with a default calendar
ProjectFile file = new ProjectFile();
file.setDefaultCalendar(file.addDefaultBaseCalendar());

// Set up example dates
DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy");
Date baselineStart = df.parse("01/05/2022");
Date startDate = df.parse("10/05/2022");

// Create a task
Task task = file.addTask();
task.setStart(startDate);
task.setBaselineStart(baselineStart);

System.out.println("Start Variance using getCachedValue(): "
   + task.getCachedValue(TaskField.START_VARIANCE));
System.out.println("Start Variance using get(): "
   + task.get(TaskField.START_VARIANCE));
System.out.println("Start Variance using getCachedValue(): "
   + task.getCachedValue(TaskField.START_VARIANCE));
```

The output from this code is:

```
Start Variance using getCachedValue(): null
Start Variance using get(): 6.0d
Start Variance using getCachedValue(): 6.0d
```

What we can see happening here is that using the `getCachedValue` method
initially returns `null` as the Start Variance is not present, and MPXJ
doesn't attempt to calculate it. When we use the `get` method, MPXJ sees that it
doesn't have a value for this field and knows how to calculate it, and
returns the expected result. Finally if we use the `getCachedValue` method
again, as we've now calculated this value and cached it, the method returns the
Start Variance.

In summary, `getCachedValue` will never attempt to calculate values for fields
which are not already present. This can be useful if you want to read a
schedule using MPXJ, but retrieve only the fields which were in the original
schedule, not calculated or inferred by MPXJ.

## Indexed Fields
So far we've seen how simple fields like Name and Start can be accessed
and modified using both field-specific and generic methods. Many organizations
rely on using general purpose fields like "Text 1" and "Date 1" to store
information relevant to their schedules. If we look for methods like `setText1`
or `setDate1` we won't find them, so how can we work with these fields?

The answer is quite straightforward, for each of these "indexed" fields you'll
find getter and setter methods which take an integer value, for example:

```java
task.setText(1, "This is Text 1");
String text1 = task.getText(1);
System.out.println("Text 1 is: " + text1);
```

If you're working with the generic `get` and `set` methods, the situation is
more straightforward as each individual field has its own enumeration, as 
shown below:

```java
task.set(TaskField.TEXT1, "This is also Text 1");
text1 = (String)task.get(TaskField.TEXT1);
System.out.println("Text 1 is: " + text1);
```

For `Task`, `Resource` and `ResourceAssignment` the following indexed fields are
available for use:

* Cost 1-10
* Date 1-10
* Duration 1-10
* Flag 1-20
* Finish 1-10
* Number 1-20
* Start 1-10
* Text 1-30
* Outline Code 1-10 (`Task` and `Resource` only)

## Populated Fields
So far we've touched on how to can read and write fields in examples where we
are targeting specific fields. If we're reading a schedule whose contents are
unknown to us, how can we tell which fields are actually populated? A typical
use-case for this might be where we need to read a schedule, then present the
user with the ability to select the columns they'd like to see in a tabular
display of the schedule contents. If you look at the various enumerations which
have mentioned previously in this section (`TaskField`, `ResourceField` and so
on) you can see that there are a large number of possible fields a user could
choose from, so ideally we only want to show a user field which actually
contain non-default values.

To solve this problem we need to use the appropriate `getPopulatedFields` method
for each of the entities we're interested in.

```java
ProjectFile file = new UniversalProjectReader().read("example.mpp");

Set<ProjectField> projectFields = file.getProjectProperties().getPopulatedFields();
Set<TaskField> taskFields = file.getTasks().getPopulatedFields();
Set<ResourceField> resourceFields = file.getResources().getPopulatedFields();
Set<AssignmentField> assignmentFields = file.getResourceAssignments().getPopulatedFields();
```

In the example above we're opening a sample file, then for each of the main
classes which implement the `FieldContainer` interface, we'll query the
container which holds those classes and call its `getPopulatedFields` method.
In each case this will return a `Set` containing the enumeration values 
representing fields which have non-default values.

## FieldType
Earlier in this section we noted that there were four main enumerations
representing the fields which particular classes can contain.

* `ProjectField`
* `ResourceField`
* `TaskField`
* `AssignmentField`

What I didn't mention earlier is that each of these enumerations inherits from a
the `FieldType` interface which defines a common set of methods each of
these enumerations must implement. The most interesting of these methods are:

* `name()`
* `getName()`
* `getFieldTypeClass()`
* `getDataType()`

The `name()` method retrieves the name of the enumeration value exactly as it
appears in the code. The `getName()` method returns a localized version of the
name, suitable for display to end users (currently English is the default and
only supported locale).

The `getFieldTypeClass()` method returns a value from the `FieldTypeClass`
enumeration which will help you to determine which class this `FieldType`
belongs to. Finally the `getDataType()` method will return a value from the
`DataType` enumeration which indicates the data type you will receive from the
`get` method when accessing this field, and the type to pass to the `set`
method when updating the field.

Here's some example code to make this a little clearer:

```java
FieldType type = TaskField.START_VARIANCE;

System.out.println("name(): " + type.name());
System.out.println("getName(): " + type.getName());
System.out.println("getFieldTypeClass(): " + type.getFieldTypeClass());
System.out.println("getDataType():" + type.getDataType());
```

In this case we're using the Task Start Variance field as an example. Here's
the output:

```
name(): START_VARIANCE
getName(): Start Variance
getFieldTypeClass(): TASK
getDataType(): DURATION
```

Returning to our earlier example of how we might allow a user to select 
fields we will display, we can use the data type of the selected field
to determine how we format the value for display.

```java
private String getStringValue(FieldContainer container, FieldType type)
{
    Object value = container.get(type);
    if (value == null)
    {
        return "";
    }

    String result;
    switch (type.getDataType())
    {
        case CURRENCY:
        {
            result = new DecimalFormat("£0.00").format((Number)value);
            break;
        }

        case DATE:
        {
            result = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy").format((Date)value);
            break;
        }

        case BOOLEAN:
        {
            result = ((Boolean)value).booleanValue() ? "Yes" : "No";
            break;
        }

        default:
        {
            result = value.toString();
            break;
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

The sample code above implements a generic method which can work with any class
implementing the `FieldContainer` interface (for example, `Task`, `Resource`
and so on). Given the particular field the user has asked us to display
(passed in via the `type` argument), we retrieve the value from the container
as an `Object`, then use the data type to decide how best to format the value
for display. (This is obviously a contrived example - I wouldn't recommend
creating new instances of `DecimalFormat` and `SimpleDateFormat` each time you
need to format a value!)


## Custom Fields
MPXJ uses the term "custom fields" to group together a couple of related
concepts. For Microsoft Project, generally speaking each entity
(Task, Resource , Resource Assignment and so on) has a fixed set of fields
available for use. The general purpose "indexed" fields (for example, Text
1-10, Number 1-10 and so on) are available to be used as you wish to meet your
own needs. Typically these can be customized by changing the label which is
shown in Microsoft Project to identify this field to a meaningful reflecting
its use. MPXJ refers to this as the field's alias.

Along with simply renaming the field using an alias, there are a variety of
other configuration options available allowing lookup tables to be created to
make data entry for these fields easier, or constrain the values a user enters.
Masks can also be applied to guide the accepted format of any data entered in
the field.

Other scheduling applications like P6 have the concept of User Defined Fields
(UDFs) where the user has the ability to create entirely new fields, assign
them a name and data type, and potentially provide other configuration like
lookup tables. As noted elsewhere MPXJ follows Microsoft Project's model of
using a fixed set of fields, so any UDFs defined in applications like P6 are
mapped onto the available "indexed" fields. For example, the first text UDF a
user defines for tasks in P6 might be mapped to the Text 1 field in MPXJ, the
next text UDF a user defines might be Text 2 and so on.

Now we've seen how MPXJ handles these fields, how can we use them?

Information about custom field configurations can be obtained from the
`CustomFieldsContainer`. The sample code below provides a simple illustration
of how we can query this data.

```java
ProjectFile file = new UniversalProjectReader().read("example.mpp");

CustomFieldContainer container = file.getCustomFields();
for (CustomField field : container)
{
    FieldType type = field.getFieldType();
    String typeClass = type.getFieldTypeClass().toString();
    String typeName = type.name();
    String alias = field.getAlias();
    System.out.println(typeClass + "." + typeName + "\t" + alias);
}
```

Depending on how your schedule is configured, you'll see output like this:

```
TASK.TEXT1      Change Request Reason
TASK.NUMBER1    Number of Widgets Required
RESOURCE.DATE1  Significant Date
```

In the source above, the first thing we're retrieving from each `CustomField`
instance is the `FieldType`, which identifies the field we're configuring. The
values we retrieve here will be from one of the enumerations we've touched on
previously in this section, for example `TaskField`, `ResourceField` and so
on.

The next thing we're doing in our sample code is to create a representation of
the parent type to which this field belongs, followed by the name of the field
itself (this is what's providing us with the value `TASK.TEXT1` for example).
Finally we're displaying the alias which has been set by the user for this
field.

> It's important to note that for schedules from Microsoft
> Project, there won't necessarily be a `CustomField` entry for
> the "indexed fields" in use in a schedule. For example, if a user has

> unless they have configured Text 1 in some way (for example by setting an
> alias or adding a lookup table) there won't be an entry in the
> `CustomFieldContainer`.

As well as iterating through the collection of `CustomField` instances for the
current schedule, you can directly request the `CustomField` instance for a
specific field, as shown below:

```java
CustomField fieldConfiguration = container.get(TaskField.TEXT1);
```

One common use-case for the configuration data help in `CustomFieldContainer` is
to locate particular information you are expecting to find in the schedule. For
example, let's say that you know that the schedule you're reading should have a
field on each task which users have named "Number of Widgets Required". You can
determine which field contains this data using a method call similar to the one
shown below:

```java
FieldType fieldType = container.getFieldTypeByAlias(FieldTypeClass.TASK,
   "Number of Widgets Required");
```

Note that the first argument we need to pass identifies which parent entity
we're expecting to find the field in. The `CustomFieldContainer` will have
entries from all field containers (tasks, resources, resource assignments and
son on) so this is used to locate the correct one - particularly useful if, for
example, a task and a resource might both have a field with the same alias!
Remember: this method will return `null` if we don't have a field with the
alias you've provided.

Once we have the `FieldType` of the field we're looking for,  we can use his to
retrieve the value using the `get` method as we've seen earlier in this
section:

```java
Task task = file.getTaskByID(Integer.valueOf(1));
Object value = task.get(fieldType);
```

Finally, there are a couple of convenience methods to make retrieving a field by
its alias easier. The first is that each "container" class for the various
entities also provides a `getFieldTypeByAlias` method. If you know ahead of
time you're looking for a field in a particular entity, this will simplify your
code somewhat. The example below illustrates this: as we're looking for a task
field we can go straight to the `TaskContainer` and ask for the field with the
alias we're looking for:

```java
fieldType = file.getTasks().getFieldTypeByAlias("Number of Widgets Required");
```

Lastly, you _can_ actually retrieve the value of a field directly from the
parent entity using its alias, as shown below:

```java
value = task.getFieldByAlias("Number of Widgets Required");
```

This is not recommended where you are iterating across multiple tasks to
retrieve values: it's more efficient to look up the `FieldType` once before you
start, then use that to retrieve the value you are interested in from each
task.
