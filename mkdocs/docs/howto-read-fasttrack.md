## How To: Read FastTrack Schedule files
FastTrack Schedule writes schedule data to FTS files. Note that MPXJ has only been tested with FTS files produced by FastTrack 10.

### Reading FTS files
The simplest way to read an FTS file is to use the `UniversalProjectReader`:

```java
import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile;
import net.sf.mpxj.reader.UniversalProjectReader;

...

UniversalProjectReader reader = new UniversalProjectReader();
ProjectFile project = reader.read("my-sample.fts");
```

You can work directly with the `FastTrackReader` by replacing `UniversalProjectReader` with `FastTrackReader`, although this offers no particular advantage as there are no additional configuration settings available on the `FastTrackReader` class.
