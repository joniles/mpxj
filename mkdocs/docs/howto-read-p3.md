## How To: Read P3 files
A Primavera P3 installation stores project data as a database consisting of a number of individual files. In a typical P3 installation files for a number of different projects live in a single projects directory. A P3 user can back up an individual project to create a PRX file, which is a compressed archive containing all of the files from a single project.

### Reading PRX files
The simplest way to read a PRX file is to use the `UniversalProjectReader`:

```java
import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile;
import net.sf.mpxj.reader.UniversalProjectReader;

...

UniversalProjectReader reader = new UniversalProjectReader();
ProjectFile project = reader.read("my-sample.prx");
```

You can work directly with the `P3PRXFileReader` by replacing `UniversalProjectReader` with `P3PRXFileReader`, although this offers no particular advantage as there are no additional configuration settings available on the `P3PRXFileReader` class.

### Reading a P3 directory
If you are working with a directory containing P3 project data you have two options. If you know that the directory only contains a single project, you can use the `UniversalProjectReader`:

```java
import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile;
import net.sf.mpxj.reader.UniversalProjectReader;

...

UniversalProjectReader reader = new UniversalProjectReader();
ProjectFile project = reader.read("my-p3-directory");
```

If the directory happens to contain multiple projects the `UniversalProjectReader` will simply read the first one it finds, in alphabetic order.

If you know that the directory you are working with contains multiple projects, you will need to use the `P3DatabaseReader` class.

```java
import java.util.List;
import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile;
import net.sf.mpxj.primavera.p3.P3DatabaseReader;

...

// Find a list of the project names
String directory = "my-p3-directory";
List<String> projectNames = P3DatabaseReader.listProjectNames(directory);

// Tell the reader which project to work with
P3DatabaseReader reader = new P3DatabaseReader();
reader.setProjectName(projectNames.get(0));

// Read the project
ProjectFile project = reader.read(directory);
```

As the example above shows, the `P3DatabaseReader` class provides a method which lists the names of the P3 projects it finds in a directory. You can then select which project you want to load, and call the `setProjectName` method of the reader to make this selection. You can then call the `read` method passing in the name of the directory, and the reader will extract data for the selected project.
