# Supported Formats

* **MPX:** The MPX file format can be read by versions of Microsoft
Project up to and including Microsoft Project 2010, and written by versions of
Microsoft Project up to Microsoft Project 98. Applications other than Microsoft
Project also commonly write MPX files as a way of sharing project data. MPXJ
can read and write MPX files.
See [this Microsoft support article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/270139)
for a definition of the file format.

* **MPP:** Microsoft Project by default stores projects as MPP files.
MPXJ supports read only access to MPP files produced by Microsoft
Project from Microsoft Project 98 onwards (Microsoft Project 98, Microsoft
Project 2000, Microsoft  Project 2002, Microsoft Project 2003, Microsoft
Project 2007, Microsoft Project 2010, Microsoft Project 2013, Microsoft Project
2016, and Microsoft Project 2019). MPP template files, with the suffix MPT can
also be read by MPXJ.

* **MSPDI:** The MSPDI file format is Microsoft's XML file format for
sharing project data. Versions of Microsoft Project from 2002 onwards can read
and write MSPDI files.  Applications other than Microsoft Project also
commonly write MSPDI files as a way of sharing project data. 
MPXJ can read and write MSPDI files.
The MSDPI file format has remained
broadly unchanged since it was introduced, although several versions of
Microsoft Project have tweaked the file format slightly, and have their own
updated documentation.
Documentation is [available online here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office-project/xml-data-interchange/project-xml-data-interchange-schema-reference).
Documentation for the Project 2003 MSPDI file format can be downloaded as
part of the [Office 2003 XML Reference Schemas](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=101) package.
Documentation for the Project 2007 MSPDI file format can be downloaded as part
of the [Project 2007 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2432). Documentation
for the Project 2010 MSPDI file format can be downloaded as part of the
[Project 2010 Reference: Software Development Kit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15511).
Documentation for the Project 2013 MSPDI file format can be downloaded as part
of the [Project 2013 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30435).

* **MPD:** The Microsoft Project MPD file format is a Microsoft Access database
used to store one or more projects. Versions of
Microsoft Project from Microsoft Project 98 to Microsoft Project 2003 can write
MPD files. Later versions of Microsoft Project can read MPD files but can't
write them. MPXJ can read MPD files natively, without using a JDBC driver, or
via a JDBC connection. MPXJ supports reading MPD files written by versions of
Microsoft Project 2000 onwards.

* **PLANNER:** [Gnome Planner](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Planner)
is a cross-platform Open Source project management tool which uses an XML file

* **PRIMAVERA P6:** [Primavera P6](https://www.oracle.com/uk/construction-engineering/primavera-p6/)
is an industry-leading tool favoured by users with complex planning
requirements. It can export project data in the form of XER or PMXML files,
both of which MPXJ can read and write. It is also possible for MPXJ to connect
directly to a P6 database via JDBC to read project data, or if a standalone
SQLite P6 database is being used, MPXJ can read projects from this natively
without using JDBC. The PMXML schema forms part of the P6 distribution media,
which can be downloaded from the
[Oracle Software Delivery Cloud](https://edelivery.oracle.com/).

* **PRIMAVERA P3:** Primavera P3 (Primavera Project Planner) is the forerunner
of P6. It stores each project as a directory containing Btrieve database files
which MPXJ can read from the directory itself or from a zip archive of the
directory. MPXJ can also read P3 data from PRX backup files.

* **PRIMAVERA SURETRAK:** Primavera SureTrak is an early iteration of the
application which eventually became Primavera P6. SureTrak stores each project
as a directory containing Btrieve database files which MPXJ can read from the
directory itself or from a zip archive of the directory. MPXJ can also read
SureTrak data from STX backup files.

* **POWERPROJECT:** [Asta Powerproject](https://elecosoft.com/products/asta/asta-powerproject/)
is a planning tool used in a number of industries, particularly construction.

driver, or via a JDBC connection.
