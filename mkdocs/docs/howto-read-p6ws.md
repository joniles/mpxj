# How To: Read Primavera P6 Web Services

Primavera P6 Web Services (p6ws) provides SOAP and REST APIs to allow you to access
data held in Primavera P6. Often installed as part of Primavera P6 Enterprise
Project Portfolio Management (EPPM) product, but can also be installed
independently for use to provide API access to a central P6 database. This
is often the case with Oracle-hosted Primavera P6 Professional services. Third
party P6 hosting services may also provide access to p6ws.
