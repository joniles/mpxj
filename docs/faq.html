         </a></dt>
<dd>
				
<p>
					Not at present. Although it is technically feasible to generate
					an MPP file, the knowledge we have of the file structure is still
					relatively incomplete, despite the amount of data we are able to
					correctly extract. It is therefore likely to take a considerable
					amount of development effort to make this work, and it is
					conceivable that we will not be able to write the full set of
					attributes that MPXJ supports back into the MPP file - simply
					because we don't understand the format well enough. You are
					therefore probably better off using MSPDI which does support
					the full range of data items present in an MPP file.

<dd>
				
<p>
					In short, the answer to this question is no. The only file format
					which allows you to control the appearance of project data
					when opened in Microsoft Project is MPP. Just to clarify, visual
					appearance in this context refers to the view that appears when
					the project opens, the filtering applied to the view, the table
					data visible, the columns in the table, bar styles, text styles
					and so on. While MPXJ can read this information from an MPP file,
					none of the supported output file formats contain these attributes.

			</a></dt>
<dd>
				
<p>
					This isn't an issue with MPXJ - but we have an answer for you
					anyway! The problem is caused by a incorrect setting in Microsoft
					Windows which controls the way MPX files are opened. To fix the
					setting, open the Control Panel and click on the &quot;Folder Options&quot;
					icon. Select the &quot;File Types&quot; tab and scroll down the list of
					file types until you find an entry for MPX. Once you have found
					the entry for MPX, click on it to highlight it, then press the
					&quot;Advanced&quot; button at the bottom right hand side of the dialog.
					In the list of actions that you are now presented with, click on
					the word &quot;open&quot; to highlight it, then click the &quot;Edit&quot; button
					on the right hand side of the dialog. Finally, ensure that the
					&quot;Use DDE&quot; check box is not checked, and you can now finish by
					clicking OK on each of the open dialogs to dismiss them. You
					should now find that double clicking on an MPX file will now
					only open one copy of the file in Microsoft Project.

<dd>
				Yes, MPXJ doesn't use any Java 1.6 specific features. If you set
				the target JRE version to 1.5 in the ant build file, you will be
				able to rebuild MPXJ for Java 1.5. You will also need to provide
				the JAXB libraries if they are not present in the JRE. The required

<p>
					The MPP8 file format is rather cryptic, and one part of it that
					I have yet to really understand fully is how the Flag fields
					are stored. I've spent a lot of time looking at this and have
					not made a lot of progress, so at the moment no further work is
					being undertaken to fix this. Contributions of insights,

<dd>
				
<p>
					Microsoft Project is sensitive to the order in which records
					appear in the MPX file. The correct order is Calendars,
					Resources, and Tasks. The current MPX implementation provided
					by MPXJ will add the records to the file in the correct
					order. Previous versions added the records to the file
					in the order supplied by the developer.
					Therefore if you didn't add them in
					the order expected by Microsoft Project, you wouldn't get the
					results you expect. As noted above, the most recent versions
					of MPXJ manage the order of records in the file for you, so
					you should no longer see this problem.

				When I read an MPP file I sometimes see an extra task or resource

         </a></dt>
<dd>
				
<p>
					What you are seeing are &quot;hidden&quot; tasks and resources
					which newer versions of Microsoft Project appear to use as
					placeholders for summary information about all of the tasks
					and all of the resources in a project. We're not sure exactly
					which versions of Project hold data like this, although we
					think this is only relevant for the MPP9 and MPP12 file formats.
					We've also noticed that the information in these hidden
					tasks and resources may not be reliable, so don't place
					too much emphasis on them in your application.
           </p>
				
<p>
					You can ignore the first resource if it has a null
					value as its name. The attributes of this resource should
					actually be a summary of all of the resource combined,
					e.g. utilisation, actual work, remaining work and so on for
					the complete set of &quot;real&quot; resources. 
           </p>
				
<p>
					You can ignore the first task if it has an outline level
					of zero, this task will be a summary of all the &quot;real&quot;
					tasks in the project. You may also find that the name of
					this task matches the name of the project.

<dd>
				
<p>
					Localised versions of MS Project (i.e. those which have been translated
					for use in a non-English locale) read and write MPX files which
					include
					localised text strings. The end result of this is that an
					English/International
					version of MS Project can't read MPX files produced by a localised version
					of
					MS Project, and vice versa.
           </p>
				
<p>
					MPXJ supports a small number of non-English locales, and can read and
					write MPX
					files correctly for those locales. You can also use MPXJ to translate
					MPX
					files from one locale to another. The MPXFile.setLocale() method must be
					called
					prior to reading or writing an MPX file in order to set the required
					locale.
					By default MPXJ will always produce MPX files for the
					International/English locale,
					regardless of the locale for which your operating system if configured.
           </p>
				
<p>
					Currently supported locales for MPX files include German, Spanish,
					French, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, and Simplified Chinese.
					Producing a translation for you locale is very easy, please
					contact us for details on how you can help us to do this.

<p>
					One of the first things the MPXWriter's write method does is
					to determine the current locale and update various project
					settings (for example, currency and date formats) to match
					the selected locale. This behaviour can be changed so that the
					settings in the project are left unmodified by setting the
					useLocaleDefaults parameter to false when calling
					the write method (for versions of MPXJ up to and including 3.0.0)
					or by calling the method setUseLocaleDefaults on the MPXWriter
					instance before calling the write method (for versions of MPXJ
					after 3.0.0).

<p>
					Older versions of JAXB were known to have issues with the
					JUnit classloader, so running the JUnit test runner with the
					-noloading command line option, other taking other steps to
					disable JUnit classloading was recommended. This problem is
					not believed to affect the more recent version of JAXB now
