Although it is technically feasible to generate an MPP file, the knowledge we have of the file structure is still relatively incomplete, despite the amount of data we are able to correctly extract. It is therefore likely to take a considerable amount of development effort to make this work, and it is conceivable that we will not be able to write the full set of attributes that MPXJ supports back into the MPP file - simply because we don't understand the format well enough. You are therefore probably better off using MSPDI which does support the full range of data items present in an MPP file.</p> <p>I'm generating output using MPXJ, and when my end users open the file in Microsoft Project, I want to control the appearance of the project data that they see. Can I do this with MPXJ?</p> <p>In short, the answer to this question is no. The only file format which allows you to control the appearance of project data when opened in Microsoft Project is MPP. Just to clarify, visual appearance in this context refers to the view that appears when the project opens, the filtering applied to the view, the table data visible, the columns in the table, bar styles, text styles and so on. While MPXJ can read this information from an MPP file, none of the supported output file formats contain these attributes.</p> <p>When I double click on an MPX file to open it in Microsoft Project, I end up with two copies of the file open. What's happening?</p> <p>This isn't an issue with MPXJ - but we have an answer for you anyway! The problem is caused by an incorrect setting in Microsoft Windows which controls the way MPX files are opened. To fix the setting, open the Control Panel and click on the \"Folder Options\" icon. Select the \"File Types\" tab and scroll down the list of file types until you find an entry for MPX. Once you have found the entry for MPX, click on it to highlight it, then press the \"Advanced\" button at the bottom right hand side of the dialog. In the list of actions that you are now presented with, click on the word \"open\" to highlight it, then click the \"Edit\" button on the right hand side of the dialog. Finally, ensure that the \"Use DDE\" check box is not checked, and you can now finish by clicking OK on each of the open dialogs to dismiss them. You should now find that double clicking on an MPX file will now only open one copy of the file in Microsoft Project.</p> <p>I use a version of Java older than Java 8, can I use MPXJ?</p> <p>The last version of MPXJ which supports versions of Java prior to Java 8 is version 7.9.8.</p> <p>I use a Java 1.4 JVM, but MPXJ is built with a later version of Java, is there anything I can do which will allow me to use it?</p> <p>Yes there is. Assuming you are using a version of MPXJ prior to 8.0.0, try using Retroweaver.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#known-issues-with-mpxj","title":"Known Issues with MPXJ","text":"<p>I have an MPP file created by MS Project 98, and some Flag field values are incorrect.</p> <p>The MPP8 file format is rather cryptic, and one part of it that I have yet to really understand fully is how the Flag fields are stored. I've spent a lot of time looking at this and have not made a lot of progress, so at the moment no further work is being undertaken to fix this. Contributions of insights, knowledge or fixed code for this problem are welcome. You'll find a bug for this item logged in the SourgeForge bug tracker.</p> <p>When I read an MPP file I sometimes see an extra task or resource record.</p> <p>What you are seeing are \"hidden\" tasks and resources which newer versions of Microsoft Project appear to use as placeholders for summary information about all of the tasks and all of the resources in a project. We're not sure exactly which versions of Project hold data like this, although we think this is only relevant for the MPP9 and MPP12 file formats. We've also noticed that the information in these hidden tasks and resources may not be reliable, so don't place too much emphasis on them in your application.</p> <p>You can ignore the first resource if it has a null value as its name. The attributes of this resource should actually be a summary of all of the resource combined, e.g. utilisation, actual work, remaining work and so on for the complete set of \"real\" resources.</p> <p>You can ignore the first task if it has an outline level of zero, this task will be a summary of all the \"real\" tasks in the project. You may also find that the name of this task matches the name of the project.</p> <p>My localised version of MS Project won't read the MPX files created by MPXJ, or MPXJ won't read the MPX files written by my localised version of MS Project.</p> <p>Localised versions of MS Project (i.e. those which have been translated for use in a non-English locale) read and write MPX files which include localised text strings. The end result of this is that an English/International version of MS Project can't read MPX files produced by a localised version of MS Project, and vice versa.</p> <p>MPXJ supports a small number of non-English locales, and can read and write MPX files correctly for those locales. You can also use MPXJ to translate MPX files from one locale to another. The MPXFile.setLocale() method must be called prior to reading or writing an MPX file in order to set the required locale. By default, MPXJ will always produce MPX files for the International/English locale, regardless of the locale for which your operating system if configured.</p> <p>Supported locales for MPX files currently include German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, and Simplified Chinese. Producing a translation for your locale is very easy, please contact us for details on how you can help us to do this.</p> <p>When I write an MPX file, changes to the project header settings I've made seem to be lost, what's happening?</p> <p>One of the first things the MPXWriter's write method does is to determine the current locale and update various project settings (for example, currency and date formats) to match the selected locale. This behaviour can be changed so that the settings in the project are left unmodified by setting the useLocaleDefaults parameter to false when calling the write method (for versions of MPXJ up to and including 3.0.0) or by calling the method setUseLocaleDefaults on the MPXWriter instance before calling the write method (for versions of MPXJ after 3.0.0).</p>"},{"location":"faq/#unit-tests","title":"Unit Tests","text":"<p>I am trying to run the MPXJ unit tests and I'm having problems with failures in JAXB functionality. What's happening?</p> <p>Older versions of JAXB were known to have issues with the JUnit classloader, so running the JUnit test runner with the -noloading command line option, other taking other steps to disable JUnit classloading was recommended.

By default the only dependency POI has on log4j2 is to its interfaces. If you're not already using log4j2 as part of your code, and you don't explicitly include the rest of the log4j2 implementation jar files, you'll see the warning message shown above. This message can safely be ignored, it's just telling you that any log messages POI produces will be written to the console. If you would like to silence this message, you can supply the following argument to the JVM:</p> <pre><code>-Dlog4j2.loggerContextFactory=org.apache.logging.log4j.simple.SimpleLoggerContextFactory\n</code></pre> <p>If you are using the Python version of MPXJ, you can provide the argument as shown

the library continues between releases and is driven by user requests for new functionality and bug fixes being applied to existing features. Many MPXJ users will work with and ship software based on  intermediate versions of MPXJ built from the code on GitHub in order to take advantage of these enhancements before they become available in an official  release. This approach is supported by the fact that code is only pushed to  the master branch on GitHub if the suite of regression tests have been completed successfully:  therefore the quality of the code taken from GitHub at any point can normally be guaranteed  to be as good as that in an official release.</p> <p>In order to take advantage of MPXJ functionality from GitHub, you will need to  understand how to build the library, whether you are using it in the form of a Java JAR or a .NET DLL.

They are in turn used to define the time period over which a task is scheduled. There are two types of calendar:  base calendars and resource calendars. Each base calendar provides a complete  definition of the working and non working time for each day of the week.  Resource calendars are associated with individual resources. Each resource  calendar is derived from a base calendar; resource calendars may be unmodified in which case it will appear to be identical to the underlying base calendar,  or the resource calendar may modify the working and non-working days. In this case these changes are \"overlaid\" on top of the working and non-working times defined by the base calendar. The calendars defined in a project can be retrieved using the method call shown below.</p> <pre><code>List&lt;ProjectCalendar&gt; calendars = file.getCalendars();\n</code></pre> <p>Normally a task without resource assignments will be scheduled with reference  to the \"Standard\" (default) calendar defined as part of the project.

For example the getDays method will retrieve an array of flags indicating the working/non-working/default state of each day of the week as defined by the current calendar. The getDay method however will test the current calendar to see if it is a working or non-working day. If the  flag in the current calendar is set to \"default\", the method will use the base calendar from which the current calendar is derived to determine if the day is working or non-working.   </p> <p>As noted above a calendar contains a set of flags which represent  each day of the week, these  indicate the day of the week is working non-working, or \"default\".

Each TimephasedResourceAssignment defines four attributes: a start date, an end date, a total amount of work, and an amount of work per day.</p> <p>For example, you may retrieve an instance of the TimephasedResourceAssignment class whose start and end date defines a five day period. The total work for the period is  40 hours, and the work per day is defined as 8 hours.

It is important to remember that  non-working days are ignored, so for example if we have a 7 day period which  spans a weekend, the total work could still be 40 hours, and the work per day 8 hours: only the 5 working days are allocated work, the non-working weekend days have zero hours of work performed.   </p> <p>The two lists defined above will contain multiple  TimephasedResourceAssignment instances where different numbers of hours are  worked on different days.

These lists may overlap by a single day if they are being used to show a partially completed day's work. For example, during a normal 8 hour working day, if 4 hours of work has been completed, and 4 hours remains, then the list of completed timephased data will end with 4 hours of work which have been completed,  and the planned work list will start with the 4 hours remaining on the same day.</p>"},{"location":"howto-use-calendars/","title":"How To: Use Calendars","text":"<p>Calendars are the foundation on which schedules are built.

Now we'll need to work with a specific date, and add an \"exception\" for this date. The terminology here can be slightly confusing when coming from a programming background, but the term exception is often used by scheduling applications in the context of making ad-hoc adjustments to a calendar.</p> <pre><code>LocalDate exceptionDate = LocalDate.of(2022, 5, 10);\n\nboolean workingDate = calendar.isWorkingDate(exceptionDate);\nSystem.out.println(exceptionDate + \" is a \"\n   + (workingDate ? \"working\" : \"non-working\") + \" day\");\n</code></pre> <p>In the code above we're creating a <code>LocalDate</code> instance to represent the date we want to add an exception for. The code uses the <code>isWorkingDate</code> method to determine whether or not the  given date is a working day. Before we add the exception, here's the output we get:</p> <pre><code>2022-05-10 is a working day\n</code></pre> <p>Now we can create our exception.</p> <pre><code>ProjectCalendarException exception = calendar.addCalendarException(exceptionDate);\nexception.setName(\"A day off\");\n</code></pre> <p>The code above illustrates adding an exception for a single day. The code above also shows that optionally an exception can be named, this can make it easier to understand the purpose of each exception. Now if we re-run our code which displays whether our chosen date is a working day, this is what we see:</p> <pre><code>2022-05-10 is a non-working day\n</code></pre> <p>We have successfully added an exception to turn this date into a day off!</p> <p>Perhaps we were being a little too generous in giving ourselves the entire day off, perhaps in this case we should make this a half day instead. To do that, we just need to add a time range to the exception:</p> <pre><code>startTime = LocalTime.of(8, 0);\nfinishTime = LocalTime.of(12, 0);\nexception.add(new LocalTimeRange(startTime, finishTime));\n</code></pre> <p>Now if we look at our chosen date, this is what we see:</p> <pre><code>2022-05-10 is a working day\n</code></pre> <p>Let's take a closer look at what's happening on that day:</p> <pre><code>System.out.println(\"Working time on Tuesdays is normally \"\n   + calendar.getWork(DayOfWeek.TUESDAY, TimeUnit.HOURS) + \" but on \"\n   + exceptionDate + \" it is \"\n   + calendar.getWork(exceptionDate, TimeUnit.HOURS));\n</code></pre> <p>The code above shows how we use the <code>getWork</code> method which takes a <code>DayOfWeek</code> as an argument to look at what the default working hours are on a Tuesday, then we use the <code>getWork</code> method which takes a <code>LocalDate</code> instance as an argument to see what's happening on the specific Tuesday of our exception. Here's the output we get:</p> <pre><code>Working time on Tuesdays is normally 8.0h but on 2022-05-10 it is 4.0h\n</code></pre> <p>We can see the effect of adding a <code>LocalTimeRange</code> to our exception: we've gone from an exception which changes a working day into a non-working day to an exception which just changes the number of working hours in the day. This same approach can be used to change a date which falls on a day that's typically non-working (for example a Sunday) into a working day, just by adding an exception with some working hours.</p> <p>We can also use a single exception to affect a number of days. First let's write a little code to see the number of working hours over a range of days:</p> <pre><code>private void dateDump(ProjectCalendar calendar, LocalDate startDate, LocalDate endDate)\n{\n   for (LocalDate date = startDate; date.isBefore(endDate); date = date.plusDays(1)) {\n      System.out.println(date + \"\\t\" + calendar.getWork(date, TimeUnit.HOURS));\n   }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Running this code with our calendar as its stands produces this output for the example week we're using:</p> <pre><code>2022-05-23  0.0h\n2022-05-24  8.0h\n2022-05-25  8.0h\n2022-05-26  8.0h\n2022-05-27  8.0h\n</code></pre> <p>Let's add an exception which covers Tuesday to Thursday that week (24th to 26th), and changes the working hours, so there are now only four hours of work per day (9am to 12pm):</p> <pre><code>LocalDate exceptionStartDate = LocalDate.of(2022, 5, 24);\nLocalDate exceptionEndDate = LocalDate.of(2022, 5, 26);\nexception = calendar.addCalendarException(exceptionStartDate, exceptionEndDate);\nstartTime = LocalTime.of(9, 0);\nfinishTime = LocalTime.of(13, 0);\nexception.add(new LocalTimeRange(startTime, finishTime));\n</code></pre> <p>Here we can see that we're using a different version of the <code>addCalendarException</code> method which takes a start and an end date, rather that just a single date. Running our code again to print out the working hours for each day now gives us this output:</p> <pre><code>2022-05-23  0.0h\n2022-05-24  4.0h\n2022-05-25  4.0h\n2022-05-26  4.0h\n2022-05-27  8.0h\n</code></pre> <p>As we can see, we've changed multiple days with this single exception.</p>"},{"location":"howto-use-calendars/#working-weeks","title":"Working Weeks","text":"<p>So far we've looked at using <code>ProjectCalendarException</code>, which can make one change (add working hours, change working hours, or make days non-working) and apply that change to one day or a contiguous range of days.

We could construct this work pattern using exceptions: we'd need six in total, one for each of the three sets of weekend days, and one for each of the three sets of week days.</p> <p>An alternative way to do this is to set up a new working week, using the <code>ProjectCalendarWeek</code> class. \"Working Week\" is perhaps a slightly misleading name, as a <code>ProjectCalendarWeek</code> can be set up for an arbitrary range of dates, from a few days to many weeks. What it represents is the pattern of working an non-working time over the seven days of a week, and this pattern is applied from the start to the end of the date range we configure.</p> <p>The <code>ProjectCalendar</code> we've been working with so far is actually already a form of working week (they share a common parent class).

With this we'll add a new working week definition and give it a name, to make it easily identifiable. Now we'll set the dates for which this work pattern is valid (in this case the first three weeks of October). Finally we mark every day as a working day.

Full details of how to use <code>RecurringData</code> are provided elsewhere as they are beyond the scope of this section.</p> <p>Before we move on from recurring exceptions, one useful feature of the <code>ProjectCalendarException</code> class is the <code>getExpandedExceptions</code> method.

Name and Start are examples of standard fields which might be provided and managed by schedule applications, and have a well understood meaning. What if we have some additional data we want to capture in our schedule, but that data doesn't fit into any of these standard fields?</p> <p>Microsoft Project's solution to this problem is Custom Fields. By default Microsoft Project provides a number of general purpose fields with names like \"Text 1\", \"Text 2\", \"Date 1\", \"Date 2\" and so on, which can be used to relevant vales as part of the schedule. If we look for methods like <code>setText1</code> or <code>setDate1</code> we won't find them, so how can we work with these fields?</p> <p>The answer is quite straightforward, for each of these custom fields you'll find getter and setter methods which take an integer value, for example:</p> <pre><code>task.setText(1, \"This is Text 1\");\nString text1 = task.getText(1);\nSystem.out.println(\"Text 1 is: \" + text1);\n</code></pre> <p>If you're working with the generic <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> methods, the situation is more straightforward as each individual field has its own enumeration, as  shown below:</p> <pre><code>task.set(TaskField.TEXT1, \"This is also Text 1\");\ntext1 = (String)task.get(TaskField.TEXT1);\nSystem.out.println(\"Text 1 is: \" + text1);\n</code></pre> <p>For <code>Task</code>, <code>Resource</code> and <code>ResourceAssignment</code> the following custom fields are available for use:</p> <ul> <li>Cost 1-10</li> <li>Date 1-10</li> <li>Duration 1-10</li> <li>Flag 1-20</li> <li>Finish 1-10</li> <li>Number 1-20</li> <li>Start 1-10</li> <li>Text 1-30</li> <li>Outline Code 1-10 (<code>Task</code> and <code>Resource</code> only)</li> </ul> <p>Microsoft Project allows users to configure custom fields. This facility can be used to do something as simple as provide an alias for the field, allowing it to be displayed with a meaningful name rather than something like \"Text 1\" or \"Date 1\". Alternatively there are more complex configurations available, for example constraining the values that can be entered for a field by using a lookup table, or providing a mask to enforce a particular format.</p> <p>Information about custom field configurations can be obtained from the <code>CustomFieldsContainer</code>. The sample code below provides a simple illustration of how we can query this data.</p> <pre><code>ProjectFile file = new UniversalProjectReader().read(\"example.mpp\");\n\nCustomFieldContainer container = file.getCustomFields();\nfor (CustomField field : container)\n{\n    FieldType type = field.getFieldType();\n    String typeClass = type.getFieldTypeClass().toString();\n    String typeName = type.name();\n    String alias = field.getAlias();\n    System.out.println(typeClass + \".\" + typeName + \"\\t\" + alias);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Depending on how the custom fields in your schedule are configured, you'll see output like this:</p> <pre><code>TASK.TEXT1      Change Request Reason\nTASK.NUMBER1    Number of Widgets Required\nRESOURCE.DATE1  Significant Date\n</code></pre> <p>In the source above, the first thing we're retrieving from each <code>CustomField</code> instance is the <code>FieldType</code>, which identifies the field we're configuring. The values we retrieve here will be from one of the enumerations we've touched on previously in this section, for example <code>TaskField</code>, <code>ResourceField</code> and so on.</p> <p>The next thing we're doing in our sample code is to create a representation of the parent type to which this field belongs, followed by the name of the field itself (this is what's providing us with the value <code>TASK.TEXT1</code> for example). Finally we're displaying the alias which has been set by the user for this field.</p> <p>It's important to note that for schedules from Microsoft Project, there won't necessarily be a <code>CustomField</code> entry for all of the custom fields in use in a schedule. For example, if a user has added values to the \"Text 1\" field for each of the tasks in their schedule, but have not configured Text 1 in some way (for example by setting an alias or adding a lookup table) there won't be an entry for \"Text 1\" in the <code>CustomFieldContainer</code>.</p> <p>As well as iterating through the collection of <code>CustomField</code> instances for the current schedule, you can directly request the <code>CustomField</code> instance for a specific field, as shown below:</p> <pre><code>CustomField fieldConfiguration = container.get(TaskField.TEXT1);\n</code></pre> <p>One common use-case for the configuration data help in <code>CustomFieldContainer</code> is to locate particular information you are expecting to find in the schedule. For example, let's say that you know that the schedule you're reading should have a field on each task which users have named \"Number of Widgets Required\", and you want to read that data. You can determine which field you need by using a method call similar to the one shown below:</p> <pre><code>FieldType fieldType = container.getFieldTypeByAlias(\n    FieldTypeClass.TASK,\n   \"Number of Widgets Required\");\n</code></pre> <p>Note that the first argument we need to pass identifies which parent entity we're expecting to find the field in. The <code>CustomFieldContainer</code> will have entries from all field containers (tasks, resources, resource assignments and so on) so this is used to locate the correct one - particularly useful if, for example, a task and a resource might both have a field with the same alias! Remember: this method will return <code>null</code> if we don't have a field with the alias you've provided.</p> <p>Once we have the <code>FieldType</code> of the field we're looking for,  we can use this to retrieve the value using the <code>get</code> method as we've seen earlier in this section:</p> <pre><code>Task task = file.getTaskByID(Integer.valueOf(1));\nObject value = task.get(fieldType);\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, there are a couple of convenience methods to make retrieving a field by its alias easier. The first is that each \"container\" class for the various entities also provides a <code>getFieldTypeByAlias</code> method. If you know ahead of time you're looking for a field in a particular entity, this will simplify your code somewhat. The example below illustrates this: as we're looking for a task field we can go straight to the <code>TaskContainer</code> and ask for the field with the alias we're looking for:</p> <pre><code>fieldType = file.getTasks().getFieldTypeByAlias(\"Number of Widgets Required\");\n</code></pre> <p>Lastly, you can actually retrieve the value of a field directly from the parent entity using its alias, as shown below:</p> <pre><code>value = task.getFieldByAlias(\"Number of Widgets Required\");\n</code></pre> <p>This is not recommended where you are iterating across multiple tasks to retrieve values: it's more efficient to look up the <code>FieldType</code> once before you start, then use that to retrieve the value you are interested in from each task.</p>"},{"location":"howto-use-fields/#populated-fields","title":"Populated Fields","text":"<p>So far we've touched on how to can read and write fields in examples where we are targeting specific fields.

A typical use-case for this might be where we need to read a schedule, then present the user with the ability to select the columns they'd like to see in a tabular display of the schedule contents. If you look at the various enumerations we have mentioned previously in this section (<code>TaskField</code>, <code>ResourceField</code> and so on) you can see that there are a large number of possible fields a user could choose from, so ideally we only want to show a user fields which actually contain non-default values.</p> <p>To solve this problem we need to use the appropriate <code>getPopulatedFields</code> method for each of the entities we're interested in.</p> <pre><code>ProjectFile file = new UniversalProjectReader().read(\"example.mpp\");\n\nSet&lt;ProjectField&gt; projectFields = file.getProjectProperties().getPopulatedFields();\nSet&lt;TaskField&gt; taskFields = file.getTasks().getPopulatedFields();\nSet&lt;ResourceField&gt; resourceFields = file.getResources().getPopulatedFields();\nSet&lt;AssignmentField&gt; assignmentFields = file.getResourceAssignments().getPopulatedFields();\n</code></pre> <p>In the example above we're opening a sample file, then for each of the main classes which implement the <code>FieldContainer</code> interface, we'll query the container which holds those classes and call its <code>getPopulatedFields</code> method.

A more common approach in other applications is to allow you to create your own fields to represent the data you need to store - that way you can have exactly the fields you need, without needing to worry if you can fit your data into the fixed set of custom fields. In fact Microsoft Project also supports this concept, in the form of Enterprise Custom Fields, although these are only available if you are working with a schedule hosted in Project Server (Project 365).</p> <p>As you can imagine MPXJ can't provide dedicated getter and setter methods for these fields as it doesn't know ahead of time what they are - they're user defined! Instead we rely on the <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> methods to work with these fields.</p> <p>When a schedule is read  by MPXJ, each user defined field is represented internally by an instance of the  <code>UserDefinedField</code> class.

The default day-by-day format MPXJ writes does this for you automatically.</p> <p>In the first example below we're enabling timephased data, and using the default day-by-dat breakdown:</p> <pre><code>import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile;\nimport net.sf.mpxj.mspdi.MSPDIWriter;\n\n// ...\n\nMSPDIWriter writer = new MSPDIWriter();\nwriter.setWriteTimephasedData(true);\nwriter.write(projectFile, outputFileName);\n</code></pre> <p>In this second example we're overriding the default behaviour as asking MPXJ to write an aggregated form of the timephased data: </p> <pre><code>import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile;\nimport net.sf.mpxj.mspdi.MSPDIWriter;\n\n// ...\n\nMSPDIWriter writer = new MSPDIWriter();\nwriter.setWriteTimephasedData(true);\nwriter.setSplitTimephasedAsDays(false);\nwriter.write(projectFile, outputFileName);\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"howto-write-planner/","title":"How To: Write Planner files","text":"<p>Gnome Planner is a simple cross platform planning tool.

MPXJ allows MPX files to be created, read and written. See this Microsoft support article for a definition of the file format.</p> </li> <li> <p>MPP: The MPP file format is Microsoft's proprietary way of storing project data. MPXJ supports read only access to MPP files produced by Microsoft Project 98, Microsoft Project 2000, Microsoft  Project 2002, Microsoft Project 2003, Microsoft Project 2007, Microsoft Project 2010, Microsoft Project 2013, Microsoft Project 2016, and Microsoft Project 2019. MPP template files, with the suffix MPT are also supported.</p> </li> <li> <p>MSPDI: The MSPDI file format is Microsoft's XML file format for storing project data. Versions of Microsoft Project from 2002 onwards can read and write MSPDI files.  MPXJ allows MSPDI files to be created, read, and written. The MSDPI file format has remained broadly unchanged since it was introduced, although several versions of Microsoft Project have tweaked the file format slightly, and have their own updated documentation. Documentation is available online here. Documentation for the Project 2003 MSPDI file format can be downloaded as part of the Office 2003 XML Reference Schemas package. Documentation for the Project 2007 MSPDI file format can be downloaded as part of the Project 2007 SDK. Documentation for the Project 2010 MSPDI file format can be downloaded as part of the Project 2010 Reference: Software Development Kit. Documentation for the Project 2013 MSPDI file format can be downloaded as part of the Project 2013 SDK.</p> </li> <li> <p>MPD: The MPD file format is an Access database used to store one or more projects. The database schema used in these databases is  also close to that used by Microsoft Project Server. MPXJ can read projects stored in an MPD file using a JDBC connection. It is possible that MPXJ could  also read the same data from a Microsoft Project Server database using the same approach, but this is not something I've tested.</p> </li> <li> <p>PLANNER: Planner is an Open Source project management tool which uses an XML file format to store project data. MPXJ can read and write the Planner file format.</p> </li> <li> <p>PRIMAVERA P6: Primavera P6 is an industry-leading tool favoured by users with complex planning requirements. It can export project data in the form of XER or PMXML files, both of which MPXJ can read. It is also possible for MPXJ to connect directly to the P6 database via JDBC to read project data. MPXJ can also write PMXML and XER files  to allow data to be exported in a form which can be consumed by P6. The PMXML schema forms part of the P6 distribution media, which can be downloaded from the Oracle e-Delivery site.</p> </li> <li> <p>PRIMAVERA P3: Primavera P3 (Primavera Project Planner) is the forerunner of P6. It holds projects in Btrieve database files which MPXJ can read from a directory or from a zip archive. MPXJ can also read P3 data from PRX backup files.</p> </li> <li> <p>PRIMAVERA SURETRAK: SureTrak holds projects in Btrieve database files which MPXJ can read from a directory or from a zip archive. MPXJ can also read SureTrak data from STX backup files.</p> </li> <li> <p>POWERPROJECT: Asta Powerproject is a planning tool used in a number of industries,  particularly construction. Powerproject can save data to PP files or to MDB database files,  and MPXJ can read both of these formats.</p> </li> <li> <p>PHOENIX: Phoenix Project Manager is an easy-to-use critical path method scheduling tool aimed primarily at the construction industry. Phoenix writes PPX files which MPXJ can read. </p> </li> <li> <p>FASTTRACK: Fasttrack Schedule is general purpose planning tool. FastTrack writes FTS files which MPXJ can read.</p> </li> <li> <p>GANTTPROJECT: GanttProject is an open source general purpose planning tool. GanttProject writes GAN files which MPXJ can read.</p> </li> <li> <p>TURBOPROJECT: TurboProject is general purpose planning tool. TurboProject writes PEP files which MPXJ can read.</p> </li> <li> <p>CONECPTDRAW PROJECT: ConceptDraw PROJECT is general purpose planning tool. ConceptDraw PROJECT writes CDPX, CDPZ and CDPTZ files which MPXJ can read.</p> </li> <li> <p>SYNCHRO SCHEDULER: Synchro Scheduler is general purpose planning tool. Synchro Scheduler writes SP files which MPXJ can read.</p> </li> <li> <p>GANTT DESIGNER: Gantt Designer is a simple Gantt chart drawing tool. Gantt Designer writes GNT files which MPXJ can read.</p> </li> <li> <p>SDEF: SDEF is the Standard Data Exchange Format, as defined by the USACE (United States Army Corps of Engineers). SDEF is a fixed column format text file, used to import a project schedule up into the QCS (Quality Control System) software from USACE. MPXJ can read and write SDEF files. The specification for the file format can be found here.</p> </li> <li> <p>SCHEDULE_GRID: Schedule grid files are produced when a schedule is exported from Sage 100 Contractor. MPXJ can read schedule grid files.</p> </li> <li> <p>PROJECT COMMANDER: Project Commander files are the native file format used by the Project Commander application. Project Commander writes PC files which MPXJ can read.</p> </li> <li> <p>DELTEK OPEN PLAN: Open Plan allows export of schedules to BK3 files, which MPXJ can read.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"users/","title":"MPXJ Users","text":"<p>Here is a list of organisations and projects currently using, or believed to be using MPXJ.
