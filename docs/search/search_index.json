Added the Resource attribute Calculate Costs From Units, and added read and write support for Primavera schedules. Added the Resource and Role attribute Sequence Number, and added read and write support for Primavera schedules. Added the WBS attribute Sequence Number, and added read and write support for Primavera schedules. Ensure activity type is read from Phoenix schedules. (Contributed by Christopher John) Deprecate the CostAccount method getSequence and replace with getSequenceNumber to improve naming consistency. Deprecate the ExpenseCategory method getSequence and replace with getSequenceNumber to improve naming consistency. Avoid possible ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when reading GUID values from MPP files (Contributed by Rohit Sinha). 10.11.0 (2022-09-27) Deprecated the Resource methods getParentID and setParentID . Replaced with getParentResourceUniqueID and setParentResourceUniqueID for clarity and consistency. Added the Resource methods setParent and getParent . Added the ChildResourceContainer interface and ResourceContainer.updateStructure method to ensure that resources can be accessed hierarchically when reading a schedule. Added the ResourceAssignment methods getFieldByAlias and setFieldByAlias to simplify working with custom fields, and mkae the API consistent with existing methods on Task and Resource . Added the TaskContainer methods getCustomFields and getFieldTypeByAlias to simplify access to task custom fields. Added the ResourceContainer methods getCustomFields and getFieldTypeByAlias to simplify access to resource custom fields. Added the ResourceAssignmentContainer methods getCustomFields and getFieldTypeByAlias to simplify access to resource assignment custom fields. Added the getCustomFieldsByFieldTypeClass method to CustomFieldContainer to allow retrieval of custom field details by parent class. Deprecated the CustomFieldContainer method getFieldByAlias to be replaced by getFieldTypeByAlias to provide a more consistent method name. Don't attempt to write unknown extended attributes to MSPDI files. Don't populate graphical indicator data if the graphical indicator is not enabled. Don't set custom field aliases to empty strings. Added the CustomFieldContainer method add . Deprecated the CustomFieldContainer method getCustomField , which is replaced by the get method (which returns null if the field type is not configured) and the getOrCreate method (which will return an existing configuration or create a new one if the requested field does not yet have a configuration). 10.10.0 (2022-09-13) Add an option to import Phoenix schedules as a flat set of tasks with separate activity codes, rather than creating a hierarchy of tasks from the activity codes. Note the default is to disable this behavior so existing functionality is unchanged. (Contributed by Christopher John) Add a setProperties method to reader classes to allow configuration to be supplied via a Properties instance rather than having to call setter methods. Properties passed to the UniversalProjectReader version of this method will be forwarded to the reader class UniversalProjectReader chooses to reader the supplied file. Properties for multiple reader classes can be included in the Properties instance, each reader class will ignore irrelevant properties. Added the get method to Task , Resource , ResourceAssignment and ProjectProperties as a replacement for the getCurrentValue method. The new get method is paired with the existing set method to provide read and write access to attributes of these classes. This change is intended to improve the interfaces to these classes by making them more consistent, and thus easier to understand. Deprecated the getCurrentValue method on the Task , Resource , ResourceAssignment and ProjectProperties classes. Use the new get method instead. Add getter and setter methods for the Resource attributes Cost Center, Budget Cost, Budget Work, Baseline Budget Cost, Baseline Budget Work, Baseline Budget Cost 1-10, and Baseline Budget Work 1-10. Add getter and setter methods for the Task attributes Response Pending, Scheduled Start, Scheduled Finish, Scheduled Duration, Budget Cost, Budget Work, Baseline Budget Cost, Baseline Budget Work, Baseline Budget Cost 1-10, and Baseline Budget Work 1-10. Added support for the Resource Cost Centre attribute for MSPDI files. Move MPP file-specific functionality for determining baseline values from the Task class into the MPP reader class. Improve handling of the TaskMode attribute. Don't set a Task's Critical attribute unless we have valid slack values. Ensure ResourceAssignment calculated fields are returned correctly when using the getCurrentValue method. Ensure ProjectProperties calculated fields are returned correctly when using the getCurrentValue method. Updated to use jsoup 1.15.3 10.9.1 (2022-08-31) Ensure monthly and yearly recurrences are calculated correctly when the supplied start date is the same as the first recurrence date (Contributed by Rohit Sinha). Add support for reading task calenadrs from Phoenix files (Contributed by Rohit Sinha). Improve reliability of ProjectCleanUtility when using the replacement strategy. 10.9.0 (2022-08-23) Added the ResourceAssignment.getEffectiveRate method to allow the cost rate effective on a given date for a resource assignment to be calculated. For P6 schedules this will take account of the cost rate configuration included as part of the resource assignment. For P6 schedules, the ResourceAssignment.getCostRateTable method now takes in account any cost rate configuration details from the resource assignment when determining which table to return. A resource's Standard Rate, Overtime Rate and Cost per Use are now all derived from the resource's cost rate table, and not stored as attributes of the resource itself. The resource methods setStandardRate , setOvertimeRate , and setCostPerUse have been deprecated. These attributes can now only be set or updated by modifying the resource's cost rate table. When writing MPX files, only include attributes which have a non-empty, non-default value in at least one task or resource. When writing MPX files, ensure attributes which have calculated values are used. Add support for reading a resource assignment's rate type from P6 schedules. The rate type is accessed via the ResourceAssignment.getRateIndex method. The value returned by this method can be used to select the required rate using the CostRateTableEntry,getRate method. Add support for writing a resource assignment's rate type to PMXML files. Add support for reading a resource assignment's role from P6 schedules. The role is accessed via the ResourceAssignment.getRole and ResourceAssignment.setRole methods. Add support for writing a resource assignment's role to PMXML files. Add support for reading a resource assignment's override rate (Price / Unit) from P6 schedules. The rate is accessed via the ResourceAssignment.getOverrideRate and ResourceAssignment.setOverrideRate methods. Add support for writing a resource assignment's override rate (Price / Unit) to PMXML files. Add support for reading a resource assignment's rate source from P6 schedules. The rate source is accessed via the ResourceAssignment.getRateSource and ResourceAssignment.setRateSource methods. Add support for writing a resource assignment's rate source to PMXML files. 10.8.0 (2022-08-17) When reading P6 schedules, all five cost rates for a resource are now available via the CostRateTableEntry.getRate method. All five rates from each cost rate table entry can now be written to PMXML files. When reading files written by Microsoft Project, resource rate values now use the same units as seen by the end user rather than defaulting to hours as was the case previously. (For example, if the user sees $8/day in the source application, you will receive a Rate instance of $8/day rather than $1/hr). The values for a resource's standard rate, overtime rate, and cost per use attributes are now derived from the cost rate table. The values stored on the resource itself are only used if a cost rate table for the resource is not present. The Resource methods getStandardRateUnits and getOvertimeRateUnits are deprecated. Use the getStandardRate and getOvertimeRate methods to retrieve a Rate instance which will include the units for these rates. The Resource methods setStandardRateUnits and setOvertimeRateUnits are deprecated. Supply Rate instances to the setStandardRate and setOvertimeRate methods with the required units instead. The CostRateTableEntry methods getStandardRateUnits and getOvertimeRateUnits are deprecated. Use the getStandardRate and getOvertimeRate methods to retrieve a Rate instance which will include the units for these rates. Ensure rates are formatted \"per hour\" when writing MSPDI and PMXML files. Include cost rate tables in JSON output. 10.7.0 (2022-08-09) Use Jackcess to read Asta MDB and Microsoft Project MPD files. This allows these file to be read on platforms other than Windows. Improve support for reading correctly typed values for enterprise custom fields from MPP files. Improve array index validation when reading GUID values from MPP files. 10.6.2 (2022-06-29) Ensure ProjectCleanUtility can load dictionary words from distribution jar. Improve handling of calendars without days read from PMXML files. 10.6.1 (2022-06-14) Updated to use POI 5.2.2 Updated to use sqlite-jdbc 3.36.0.3 Updated to use jsoup 1.15.1 10.6.0 (2022-06-08) Added support for reading and writing the unique ID of P6 user defined fields via new getUniqueID and setUniqueID methods on `CustomField (based on a suggestion by Wes Lund). Added support for reading and writing scope, scope ID, and sequence number attributes for activity codes (based on a suggestion by Wes Lund). Added support for reading and writing sequence number and color attributes for activity code values (based on a suggestion by Wes Lund). Added isWorking method to ProjectCalendarException to make it clearer how to determine if the exception changes the dates it is applied to into working or non-working days. Improve reading task start from certain Planner files. Improve reading predecessor lag values from Planner files. Ensure calendar hierarchy is written correctly to Planner files. Don't write null tasks to Planner files as Planner will not read files which contain them. When writing Planner file, ignore constraint types which Planner can't represent. Don't write emply predecessor lists to Planner files. Improve handling of lag duration when writing Planner files. Improve ProjectCalendar start date calculation when we have long runs of non-working days. Performance enhancement for timephased data normalisation. 10.5.0 (2022-05-24) The ProjectCalendarWeek methods addCalendarHours() , attachHoursToDay , removeHoursFromDay have been removed. Use addCalendarHours(day) , removeCalendarHours(day) instead. (Note: this will be a breaking change if you were using the original methods to create or modify a schedule) The ProjectCalendar methods attachHoursToDay and removeHoursFromDay have been removed. Use the addCalendarHours and removeCalendarHours methods instead. (Note: this will be a breaking change if you were using the original methods to create or modify a schedule) The class hierarchy for ProjectCalendarHours and ProjectCalendarException has been simplified, but there should be no impact for uses of these classes. The ProjectCalendarHours class now implements the List interface. Methods in this class not part ofthe List interface have been deprecated in favour of the equivalent List methods. Updated MPXWriter to ensure: calendar names are quoted if necessary, all calendars have names, all calendar names are unique. Updated MPXReader to recognise wk as a valid time unit. Updated MPXWriter , PrimaveraPMFileWriter , SDEFWriter and PlannerWriter to ensure any working weeks defined by a calendar are represented by exceptons. Updated MSPDIWriter to ensure any working weeks defined by a calendar are represented in the \"legacy\" exception definition used by Microsoft Project prior to 2007. Updated SDEFWriter to ensure: only relevant calendars are written, and derived calendars are flattened. When reading Planner schedules MPXJ will no longer create an \"artificial\" resource calendar for each resource. Resources will be linked directly to the calendar used in the original schedule. Add suppport for reading the P6 calendar type and personal calendar flag from P6 schedules. Add suppport for writing the calendar type and personal calendar flag to PMXML files. Updated the calendar class hierarchy: ProjectCalendar and ProjectCalendarWeek both now inherit from a new class ProjectCalendarDays . Note that ProjectCalendar is no longer a subclass of ProjectCalendarWeek . The getHours and isWorkingDay methods have been moved up to ProjectCalendar from the ProjectCalendarWeek class. The ProjectCalendar method copy has been deprecated, without replacement. Added a getWork method to ProjectCalendar which calculates the amount of work given a Day instance. Added removeWorkWeek and removeCalendarException methods to ProjectCalendar . Recurring exceptions are now added to a ProjectCalendar using the addCalendarException method which takes a recurringData instance its argument. The ProjectCalendarException method setRecurringData has been removed, recurring exceptions should be added using the addCalendarExcepton method described above. (Note: this will be a breaking change if you were creating recurring exceptions) 10.4.0 (2022-05-05) Remove getParent , setParent , and isDerived from ProjectCalendarWeek . (Note: this will be a breaking change if you were working with ProjectCalendarWeek directly). The ProjectProperties methds getDefaultCalendarName() and setDefaultCalendarName() have been deprecated. Use getDefaultCalendar() and setDefaultCalendar() instead. Ensure that percent complete values can be read from MSPDI files even if the values are decimals. Improve handling of the default calendar when reading certain MSPDI files. Improve reading certain Phoenix PPX files. Improve reading certain FastTrack FTS files. Improve formatting of time project properties when written to JSON. Improve reading MPP files generated by Microsoft Project 16.0.15128.20158 and later versions. 10.3.0 (2022-04-29) General improvements to make calendar data read from different file formats more consistent. When reading P6 and Powerproject schedules MPXJ will no longer create an \"artificial\" resource calendar for each resource. Resources will be linked directly to the calendars they use in the original schedule. Update MPXWriter amd MSPDIWriter to ensure that, when writen, calendars are correctly structured in the form required by Microsoft Project. JsonWriter now includes calendar data as part of its output. The ProjectCalendar methods setMinutesPerDay , setMinutesPerWeek , setMinutesPerMonth and setMinutesPerYear have been deprecated, use setCalendarMinutesPerDay , setCalendarMinutesPerWeek , setCalendarMinutesPerMonth and setCalendarMinutesPerYear instead. The ProjectCalendar method setResource has been deprecated and will not be replaced. Use the Resource method setCalendar or setCalendarUniqueID to link a calendar with a resource. The ProjectCalendar method getResource has been deprecated. Use the getResources method instead to retrieve all resources linked with a calendar. The Resource methods addResourceCalendar , setResourceCalendar , getResourceCalendar , setResourceCalendarUniqueID and getResourceCalendarUniqueID have been deprecated and replaced by addCalendar , setCalendar , getCalendar , setCalendarUniqueID and getCalendarUniqueID respectively. 10.2.0 (2022-03-06) Improvements to writing currency, rate and units amounts to MSPDI files. When reading MPP and MSPDI files, calendar exceptions representing a single range of days, but defined as a recurring exception are converted to a range of days, removing the unnecessary recurring definition. Added StructuredTextParser to replace original code handling calendar data, project properties and curve data read from XER files and Primavera databases. Can also be used to extract data from Primavera Layout Files (PLF). Improve recognition of contoured resource assignments read from MPP files. Improve retrieval of resource assignment confirmed, response pending, linked fields, and team status pending flags from certain MPP files. 10.1.0 (2022-01-29) Improve PMXML file compatibility with P6. Strip any trailing invalid characters from text read from FTS files. Ensure all tasks read from Powerproject and Project Commander have unique IDs. Correct expansion of exceptions from a weekly recurring calendar exception. Ensure that expanded calendar exceptions are written to file formats which do not support recurring exceptions. Ensure that start and finish dates are set when reading milestones from GanttProject files. 10.0.5 (2022-01-11) Ensure Task.getActivityCodes() returns an empty list rather than null when no activity code values have been assigned. Default to using ASCII when reading and writing SDEF files, as per the SDEF specification. Provide methods to set and get the charset used when reading and writing SDEF files. 10.0.4 (2022-01-07) Added support for reading Code Library values (as Activity Codes) from Powerproject files. Updated ProjectCleanUtility to provide a \"replace\" strategy alongside the original \"redact\" strategy. 10.0.3 (2021-12-22) Fix issue with null tasks from certain MPP files introduced in 10.0.2. 10.0.2 (2021-12-16) Improve identification of null tasks for certain MPP files. 10.0.1 (2021-12-10) Avoid false positives when detecting password protected MPP files. 10.0.0 (2021-12-01) Added support for .NET Core 3.1 Nuget packages now explicitly target .NET Framework 4.5 ( net45 ) and .NET Core 3.1 ( netcoreapp3.1 ) 9.8.3 (2021-11-30) Improve reliability when reading certain Phoenix files. Ensure multiple trailing nul characters are stripped from text when reading schedules from a Primavera database. 9.8.2 (2021-11-01) Improve accuracy of identifying null tasks in certain MPP files. Improve accuracy of identifying valid tasks in certain MPP files. Ensure hierarchical outline code values are read correctly from MSPDI files. Improve support for files produced by recent versions of FastTrack. 9.8.1 (2021-10-13) Added support for Phoenix 5 schedules. Improve handling of null tasks read from MPP files. 9.8.0 (2021-09-30) Introduced the BaselineStrategy interface and implementing classes. (Note: this includes a breaking change if you were using the ProjectFile.setBaseline method and supplying a lambda. You will now need to implement a BaselineStrategy and set this in ProjectConfig before setting a baseline). Improved accuracy of baseline attributes for Primavera schedules. 9.7.0 (2021-09-28) Add Sprint ID and Board Status ID attributes to task. Introduce the TimeUnitDefaultsContainer to allow constants for time unit conversions to be obtained from both project properties and calendars. Duration attributes are no longer returned as Duration instances by the ruby gem, they are now returned as floating point numbers. By default, durations are expressed in seconds. A new optional argument to MPXJ::Reader.read allows you to change the units used to express durations. (Note: this is a breaking change for users of the ruby gem) Update JsonWriter to use a relevant calendar when converting durations. Ensure default calendar is set correctly when reading XER and PMXML files, and P6 databases. Use default hours per day/week/month/year when reading P6 XER files or databases if these values are not present. Ensure that the minutes per day/week/month/year attributes are copied when a calendar is copied. When reading P6 schedules, roll up calendar for WBS entries when child activities all share the same calendar. Generate missing minutes per day/week/month/year for calendars read from P6 schedules. Inherit minutes per day/week/month/year from base calendars (Note: minor method signature changes on ProjectProperties and ProjectCalendar). Allow explicit values to be set for project minutes per week and minutes per year. Fall back on defaults for project minutes per day/week/month/year attributes. 9.6.0 (2021-09-13) Add Planned Start and Scheduled Finish to project properties. Add attribute_types method to Ruby classes. Updated to use POI 5.0.0. Corrected source of Must Finish By project property when reading XER files or P6 databases. When reading PMXML files, ensure that the activity calendar is set before calculating slack. Remove unused field TaskField.PARENT_TASK. Ensure task Unique ID and task Parent Unique ID attributes are treated as mandatory when written to JSON. Fix an issue with Ruby gem where a task's parent was not being retrieved correctly in some circumstances. 9.5.2 (2021-08-22) Add Must Finish By date to project properties. Add support for the task attributes Longest Path, External Early Start and External Early Finish, and ensure they can be read from P6 schedules. Rename ProjectFile.getStartDate() and ProjectFile.getFinishDate() methods for clarity. Original method names are marked as deprecated Ensure that all activities in a PMXML file have a CalendarID attribute to ensure compatibility with older versions of P6. Ensure that the user's selected progress period is used to set the project's status date attribute when reading Asta PP files. Ensure that a task's Complete Through attribute is not advanced to the start of the next working day (the behaviour of Microsoft Project prior to 2007 was to report Complete Through as the start of the next working day. This change ensures MPXJ matches versions of Microsoft Project from 2007 onwards. Previous behaviour can be restored using the ProjectConfig.setCompleteThroughIsNextWorkStart() method). Deprecate task getSplitCompleteDuration() and setSplitCompleteDuration() in favour of getCompleteThrough() and setCompleteThrough(). Improved the implementation of the TaskContainer.synchronizeTaskIDToHierarchy method. Update jsoup to 1.14.2. 9.5.1 (2021-07-01) When applying a baseline using ProjectFile.setBaseline, gracefully handle duplicate task key values. Handle missing values populating cost rate table from an MPP file. 9.5.0 (2021-06-30) Added support for reading baseline data from embedded baselines in PP files. Correct resource assignment percent complete values read from PP files. JsonWriter no longer writes attribute type information by default. (The original behaviour can be restored by calling setWriteAttributeTypes(true) on your JsonWriter instance). The MPXJ Ruby Gem now generates explicit methods to access attributes rather than relying on \"method_missing\" to intercept and act on attribute access. Don't write Assignment Task GUID, Assignment Resource GUID or Resource Calendar GUID to JSON. Don't write a value for Assignment Work Contour to JSON if the contour is the default value (i.e. flat). Don't write a value for Assignment Resource Request Type to JSON if the type is the default value (i.e. none). Don't write a value for Task Earned Value Method to JSON if the method matches the project default. Don't write a value for Task Type to JSON if the type matches the project default. Stop writing a default value (-1) for Parent Task ID to JSON if the task does not have a parent. Stop writing a default value (-1) for Task Calendar ID to JSON if the task does not have a calendar. When reading resource assignments from an MPP file, don't record Project's internal representation of a null resource ID (-65535), record the resource ID explicitly as null. For MPX and Planner files, don't write resource assignments for the \"null\" resource. Handle missing status date when reading P6 schedules from XER files or database. When reading MPP files, treat UUID's which are all zeros as null. Deprecate the 10 Resource Outline Code get and set methods and replace with get and set methods which take an index argument. Provide a helper method (PrimaveraHelper.baselineKey) to encapsulate key generation for setting Primavera baselines. 9.4.0 (2021-06-11) Read custom value lists for resource custom fields from MPP files (based on a suggestion by Markus H\u00f6ger). Added support for reading custom fields from Asta Powerproject files. Ensure short data type values are written to JSON files as numeric values. Ensure delay data type values are written to JSON files as duration values. Don't write zero rates to JSON files. Introduced a separator into rate values when written to a JSON file to make it clear that the value is a rate not a duration (for example: 5.00h is now 5.00/h). When writing an enum value of a JSON file, ensure we write the original enum name rather than the value return by toString. This provides more meaningful output (Potentially breaking change if you use the Ruby gem or consume the JSON output directly. Affected attributes are project properties: currency symbol position, time format, date format, bar text date format, schedule from, mpx file version; resource attribute: type). Ensure invalid cost rate table data is handled gracefully when reading from MSPDI files. Handle missing data when reading MSPDI files (based on a contribution by Lord Helmchen). Improve population of summary task names when reading from Powerproject PP files. Correctly read hierarchical resource outline codes from MPP files (based on a suggestion by Markus H\u00f6ger). 9.3.1 (2021-05-18) Preserve multiple assignments between an activity and a resource when reading P6 schedules. Renamed WorkContour.isFlat to isContourFlat and WorkContour.isContoured to isContourManual. Include an entry for 0% in the WorkContour curve definition. Fix an issue where non working days were not being treated correctly in date calculations if they happen to still have time ranges attached. 9.3.0 (2021-05-06) Add support for reading roles from P6 databases, XER and PMXML files, and for writing roles to PMXML files. Roles are represented as resources. The new resource Boolean attribute \"Role\" is used to distinguish between Resource instances which represent resources and those which represent roles. Add support for reading resource curves from P6 databases, XER and PMXML files, and for writing resource curves to PMXML files. The WorkContour enum is now a class, and instance of this class are used to represent resource curves. The curves are available via the work contour attribute of resource assignments. Corrected the data type of the task physical percent complete attribute. Improve handling of non-standard relationship type representations encountered in XER files and P6 databases. 9.2.6 (2021-04-26) Handle invalid baseline numbers when reading MSPDI files. Improve custom field handling when reading GanttProject files. 9.2.5 (2021-04-20) Add launcher batch file and shell script. Improve handling of calculated task attributes when writing a project to a different format. Ensure that dates are rolled up to summary tasks when reading FastTrack files. Improve support for Synchro 6.3 SP files. 9.2.4 (2021-04-09) Fix an issue reading resource rate information GanttProject files. 9.2.3 (2021-04-08) Fix an issue reading Planned Duration from P6 databases and XER files. Ensure Duration and Actual Duration are populated for WBS entries when reading P6 schedules. 9.2.2 (2021-04-07) Fix issue with WBS ordering when writing PMXML files. 9.2.1 (2021-04-04) Improve Task critical flag calculation when reading PMXML files. Improve support for Synchro 6.3 SP files. 9.2.0 (2021-03-30) Improve accuracy when reading subprojects from MPP files. Add Remaining Late Start and Remaining Late Finish attributes to Task. Add Critical Activity Type attribute to Project Properties Read Remaining Early Start, Remaining Late Start, Remaining Early Finish and Remaining Late finish from and write to PMXML files. Read Remaining Late Start and Remaining Late finish from P6 database and XER files. Ensure that WBS entries without child activities are not marked as critical. Don't attempt to set the critical flag when reading XER and PMXML files where the schedule is using \"longest path\" to determine critical activities. (MPXJ currently doesn't have enough information to be able to determine the correct value for the critical flag in this situation). Ensure cost, duration, date and work attributes are rolled up to WBS entries for P6 schedules read from PMXML files, XER files and P6 databases. Populate baseline cost, duration, finish, start and work when reading from XER files, PMXML files and P6 databases where the \"Project Baseline\" has been set to \"Current Project\". 9.1.0 (2021-03-11) Add methods to the ProjectFile class to attach a ProjectFile instance as a baseline. The baselines attached to the ProjectFile will be used to populate the relevant baseline attributes in the current schedule. Added experimental support for writing baseline projects to PMXML files. Added the Project GUID attribute. When reading PMXML files, the list of projects returned by the readAll method will include any baseline projects present in the file. When reading PMXML files which include the current baseline project, use this to populate the relevant baseline attributes in the main schedule. The Project Unique ID property is now an integer rather than a string. When reading Primavera schedules, populate the project properties Project ID and Baseline Project Unique ID. Handle Primavera resource rates which don't have a start or finish date. Handle MSPDI files with resource availability tables which don't have a start or finish date. Ensure that the Activity ID field is populated consistently for WBS entries in PMXML files compared to the same schedule read from an XER file or P6 database. Ensure duration of manually scheduled tasks in MPP files is represented correctly. 9.0.0 (2020-02-18) NOTE: this release introduces breaking changes! All fields which are non-user defined, but were previously being returned by MPXJ as custom fields are now represented as explicit field types. Custom fields now only contain values for user-defined custom fields. All code previously marked as deprecated has been removed. When reading an XER file or a P6 database, some custom project property names have been updated. LagCalendar is now CalendarForSchedulingRelationshipLag, RetainedLogic is now WhenSchedulingProgressedActivitiesUseRetainedLogic, ProgressOverride is now WhenSchedulingProgressedActivitiesUseProgressOverride, IgnoreOtherProjectRelationships is now WhenSchedulingProgressedActivitiesUseProgressOverride, and StartToStartLagCalculationType is now ComputeStartToStartLagFromEarlyStart. Updated PMXML schema to version 20.12. Fix an issue where GUID values were not being read correctly from XER files and P6 databases. Percent complete type is now available as a task attribute for P6 schedules from any source. Ensure that percent complete values are stored in the appropriate attributes when reading P6 schedules. (NOTE: Previously the \"reported\" percent complete value was stored as the tasks \"percent complete\" attribute. Now this holds the schedule percent complete value, and the percent work complete and physical percent complete attributes are also populated. To determine which value should be reported for a task, see the \"percent complete type\" extended field attribute.) Correctly handle default calendar when reading and writing PMXML files. Update the sort order of WBS entries and activities in PMXML files to match the order exported by P6. Match the way P6 exports the WBS code attribute for PMXML files. Update the representation of Boolean values when writing PMXML files to match the form exported by P6. Set the task type attribute when reading PMXML files. Improve duration and actual duration calculations when reading XER files and P6 databases. Fix an issue where resource assignment costs were not being read correctly from PMXML files. Read and write the suspend date and resume date attributes for PMXML files. General improvements to the SDEF writer. Updated to rtfparserkit 1.16.0. 8.5.1 (2021-01-07) Don't write unused enterprise custom field definitions to MSPDI files. This ensures that MS Project will open these files correctly. 8.5.0 (2021-01-06) Notes in their original format (HTML from P6, RTF from MS Project) can now be retrieved via the getNotesObject method on Task, Resource, and ResourceAssignment. Plain text notes can still be retrieved via the getNotes method. If you were previously using the \"preserve note formatting\" flag to retrieve the original formated version of a note, you will now need to use the getNotesObject method. Write WBS and Activity notes to PMXML files. PMXML compatibility improvements to ensure files can be successfully imported into P6. 8.4.0 (2020-12-29) Previously when reading PMXML files, XER files, and P6 databases, a set of baseline attributes on tasks and assignments (including Start, Finish, Duration, Cost and Work) were being populated with planned values rather than baseline values. These baseline attributes are no longer being set. The values they previously contained are now available as custom fields. Read activity notepad entries for XER, PMXML files and P6 databases. Read schedule and leveling options from PMXML files and P6 databases. Improve support for reading activity cost and work from PMXML files. 8.3.5 (2020-12-15) Fix CVE-2020-35460: zip slip vulnerability (with thanks to Sangeetha Rajesh S, ZOHO Corporation) 8.3.4 (2020-12-10) Updated PMXML schema to version 19.12. Ensure that we always set the activity planned start and planned finish dates when writing a PMXML file. Updated the getPopulatedFields methods to ignore fields with default values. Made the Resource ID attribute available as a resource's TEXT1 custom field, with the alias \"Resource ID\" when reading PMXML and XER files, or from a P^ database. (Note that presently for XER files and P6 databases, the Resource ID value is also read into the initials attribute. This behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the next major MPXJ release). Populate the Resource ID with the value read from a P6 schedule when writing a PMXML file. Ensure that the hours per day, week, month and year attributes are read from and written to PMXML files. Fix an issue causing the hours per day calendar attribute to be read inaccurately from XER files and P6 databases. Read assignment actual overtime cost and work attributes from PMXML files. Update calculation of assignment work, cost and units attributes for PMXML files. 8.3.3 (2020-11-24) Added cost rate table support when reading from and writing to PMXML files. Added a getPopulatedFields method to the TaskContainer, ResourceContainer and ResourceAssignmentContainer classes. This will retrieve the set of fields which are populated with a non-null value across the whole project for Tasks, Resources, and ResourceAssignments respectively. Add START_ON, FINISH_ON constraint types. Deprecate MANDATORY_START, MANDATORY_FINISH constraint types. MANDATORY_START/FINISH are now represented as MUST_START/FINISH_ON. This change allows users to distinguish between START/FINISH_ON and the MANDATORY_* constraints when reading P6 schedules. Improve handling of cost rate tables and availability tables when writing to an MSPDI file. Handle P6 databases and XER files with user defined fields of type FT_FLOAT. Align invalid XER record behaviour with P6. Handle Planner files which don't contain an allocations tag.

Add support for reading expense items, expense categories and cost accounts from XER files, PMXML files and Primavera databases. Add support for writing expense items, expense categories and cost accounts to PMXML files. Updated the XER file reader to ignore invalid records rather than reporting an error, matching the behaviour of P6 Updated the XER file reader to ensure that activity suspend and resume dates are read correctly. Updated the XER file reader to ensure that if the reader returns the project selected by the caller when the caller supplies a value for project ID. Updated PMXML reader to avoid user defined field collisions. Updated PMXML reader to add setProjectID and listProjects methods. Update the .net extension method ToIEnumerable to work with java.lang.Iterable rather than java.util.Collection 8.2.0 (2020-09-09) All readers, including the UniversalProjectReader, now support a readAll method. If a file or database contains more than one project the readAll method can be used to retrieve them all in one operation. If the file format doesn't support multiple schedules, readAll will just return a single schedule. Add PrimaveraDatabaseFileReader to encapsulate access to SQLite Primavera databases. Ensure that the summary flag is true for WBS items in Primavera schedules, even if they have no child activities. Ensure that the critical flag is rolled up appropriately to WBS items when reading Primavera schedules. Set export flag property when reading projects from a PMXML file. Corrected data type of resource assignment Work Contour field. Corrected data type of resource fields: BCWS, BCWP, ACWP, SV, CV, and Work Contour.

Not at present. Although it is technically feasible to generate an MPP file, the knowledge we have of the file structure is still relatively incomplete, despite the amount of data we are able to correctly extract. It is therefore likely to take a considerable amount of development effort to make this work, and it is conceivable that we will not be able to write the full set of attributes that MPXJ supports back into the MPP file - simply because we don't understand the format well enough. You are therefore probably better off using MSPDI which does support the full range of data items present in an MPP file. I'm generating output using MPXJ, and when my end users open the file in Microsoft Project, I want to control the appearance of the project data that they see. Can I do this with MPXJ? In short, the answer to this question is no. The only file format which allows you to control the appearance of project data when opened in Microsoft Project is MPP. Just to clarify, visual appearance in this context refers to the view that appears when the project opens, the filtering applied to the view, the table data visible, the columns in the table, bar styles, text styles and so on. While MPXJ can read this information from an MPP file, none of the supported output file formats contain these attributes. When I double click on an MPX file to open it in Microsoft Project, I end up with two copies of the file open. What's happening? This isn't an issue with MPXJ - but we have an answer for you anyway! The problem is caused by an incorrect setting in Microsoft Windows which controls the way MPX files are opened. To fix the setting, open the Control Panel and click on the \"Folder Options\" icon. Select the \"File Types\" tab and scroll down the list of file types until you find an entry for MPX. Once you have found the entry for MPX, click on it to highlight it, then press the \"Advanced\" button at the bottom right hand side of the dialog. In the list of actions that you are now presented with, click on the word \"open\" to highlight it, then click the \"Edit\" button on the right hand side of the dialog. Finally, ensure that the \"Use DDE\" check box is not checked, and you can now finish by clicking OK on each of the open dialogs to dismiss them. You should now find that double clicking on an MPX file will now only open one copy of the file in Microsoft Project. I use a version of Java older than Java 8, can I use MPXJ? The last version of MPXJ which supports versions of Java prior to Java 8 is version 7.9.8. I use a Java 1.4 JVM, but MPXJ is built with a later version of Java, is there anything I can do which will allow me to use it? Yes there is. Assuming you are using a version of MPXJ prior to 8.0.0, try using Retroweaver . Known Issues with MPXJ I have an MPP file created by MS Project 98, and some Flag field values are incorrect. The MPP8 file format is rather cryptic, and one part of it that I have yet to really understand fully is how the Flag fields are stored. I've spent a lot of time looking at this and have not made a lot of progress, so at the moment no further work is being undertaken to fix this. Contributions of insights, knowledge or fixed code for this problem are welcome. You'll find a bug for this item logged in the SourgeForge bug tracker . When I read an MPP file I sometimes see an extra task or resource record. What you are seeing are \"hidden\" tasks and resources which newer versions of Microsoft Project appear to use as placeholders for summary information about all of the tasks and all of the resources in a project. We're not sure exactly which versions of Project hold data like this, although we think this is only relevant for the MPP9 and MPP12 file formats. We've also noticed that the information in these hidden tasks and resources may not be reliable, so don't place too much emphasis on them in your application. You can ignore the first resource if it has a null value as its name. The attributes of this resource should actually be a summary of all of the resource combined, e.g. utilisation, actual work, remaining work and so on for the complete set of \"real\" resources. You can ignore the first task if it has an outline level of zero, this task will be a summary of all the \"real\" tasks in the project. You may also find that the name of this task matches the name of the project. My localised version of MS Project won't read the MPX files created by MPXJ, or MPXJ won't read the MPX files written by my localised version of MS Project. Localised versions of MS Project (i.e. those which have been translated for use in a non-English locale) read and write MPX files which include localised text strings. The end result of this is that an English/International version of MS Project can't read MPX files produced by a localised version of MS Project, and vice versa. MPXJ supports a small number of non-English locales, and can read and write MPX files correctly for those locales. You can also use MPXJ to translate MPX files from one locale to another. The MPXFile.setLocale() method must be called prior to reading or writing an MPX file in order to set the required locale. By default, MPXJ will always produce MPX files for the International/English locale, regardless of the locale for which your operating system if configured. Supported locales for MPX files currently include German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, and Simplified Chinese. Producing a translation for your locale is very easy, please contact us for details on how you can help us to do this. When I write an MPX file, changes to the project header settings I've made seem to be lost, what's happening? One of the first things the MPXWriter's write method does is to determine the current locale and update various project settings (for example, currency and date formats) to match the selected locale. This behaviour can be changed so that the settings in the project are left unmodified by setting the useLocaleDefaults parameter to false when calling the write method (for versions of MPXJ up to and including 3.0.0) or by calling the method setUseLocaleDefaults on the MPXWriter instance before calling the write method (for versions of MPXJ after 3.0.0). Unit Tests I am trying to run the MPXJ unit tests and I'm having problems with failures in JAXB functionality. What's happening? Older versions of JAXB were known to have issues with the JUnit classloader, so running the JUnit test runner with the -noloading command line option, other taking other steps to disable JUnit classloading was recommended. This problem is not believed to affect the more recent version of JAXB now used by MPXJ. .NET Core When using MPXJ from .NET Core I get an error similar to No data is available for encoding 437. For information on defining a custom encoding, see the documentation for the Encoding.RegisterProvider method.

Fields"},{"location":"howto-build/","text":"Building MPXJ Although MPXJ can be downloaded as a complete package from Maven, GitHub and SourceForge, the development of the library continues between releases and is driven by user requests for new functionality and bug fixes being applied to existing features. Many MPXJ users will work with and ship software based on intermediate versions of MPXJ built from the code on GitHub in order to take advantage of these enhancements before they become available in an official release. This approach is supported by the fact that code is only pushed to the master branch on GitHub if the suite of regression tests have been completed successfully: therefore the quality of the code taken from GitHub at any point can normally be guaranteed to be as good as that in an official release. In order to take advantage of MPXJ functionality from GitHub, you will need to understand how to build the library, whether you are using it in the form of a Java JAR or a .NET DLL. The following sections explain how to do this. Obtaining the source The first step in the process of building your own version of MPXJ is to obtain the latest source from GitHub . Instructions for cloning the repository can be found on this page. Building the Java JAR MPXJ is built using Maven. Once you have a cloned copy of the MPXJ repository, you may wish to update the groupId , artifactId or version attributes in pom.xml . This will ensure that there is no confusion between the version of MPXJ you build and the official distributions. If you have a copy of Maven installed, you can issue the following command to build MPXJ: mvn -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Dsource.skip=true package This will generate the mpxj.jar for you in the Maven target directory, and copies MPXJ's dependencies to the lib directory. Note that for convenience this skips running the unit tests, javadoc generation and source packaging. If you are using Maven to manage dependencies for your own project, you can install your newly built version of MPXJ in a local Maven repository: mvn -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Dsource.skip=true install Building the .NET DLLs Building the .NET versions of MPXJ uses an Ant script to first run Maven to create the Java version, then run IKVM to create a .Net Framework and a .Net Core version. Download .Net Framework version of IKVM and unzip the files into a convenient directory Change directory to the MPXJ folder. Edit the build.xml file and ensure that the property named ikvm.net45.dir is set to point to the location where you have unzipped IKVM. You can now issue the following command: ant archive The Ant script will recognise that IKVM is present and build the .NET Framework version of MPXJ, with the results found in the src.net\\lib\\net45 folder. Generating the JAXB code In order to read and write various XML file formats, MPXJ relies on code generated by the JAXB tool xjc from the XML schema for each file format. Normally you will not need to regenerate this source, but if you are changing the JAXB implementation, or modifying the use of JAXB in some way, then you may need to regenerate this code. Where I have created an XML schema to support a particular file format, I have included it in the MPXJ distribution in the jaxb directory. For XML schemas published by product vendors, I have included a note on the home page indicating where these can be located. If you obtain a copy of the XML schema file you want to work with, you can update the JAXB source using the xjc target found in the ant build.xml file. Note that the xjc target is platform specific, you will need to change the name of xjc tool to be xjc.bat , xjc.exe , or xjc.sh depending on your operating system. You will also need to set the properties indicated in build.xml to tell it where to find xjc and the XML schema file. If you are only regenerating source for one of the XML schemas, you can comment out the others in the Ant script to avoid unnecessary work.","title":"Building MPXJ"},{"location":"howto-build/#building-mpxj","text":"Although MPXJ can be downloaded as a complete package from Maven, GitHub and SourceForge, the development of the library continues between releases and is driven by user requests for new functionality and bug fixes being applied to existing features.

The .Net assemblies and their dependencies can also be found in the zip file distribution from GitHub or SourceForge . You'll find a general introduction to MPXJ's functionality here . MPXJ assemblies MPXJ ships with a set of .Net Framework and .Net Core assemblies, which are managed for you by NuGet or can be found in the src.net\\lib\\net45 and src.net\\lib\\netcoreapp3.1 folders of the distribution respectively. There are actually three different .Net DLLs shipped with MPXJ - you only need one of these: mpxj.dll - this is the default .Net version, the API is identical to the Java version mpxj-for-csharp.dll - in this version the API has been modified to make it less like Java and more like C#: there are properties rather than getter and setter methods and the method names follow the same uppercase initial letter convention used by C#. mpxj-for-vb.dll - this version also transforms getters and setters into properties, but the method names are unchanged. VB is case insensitive and can't cope with the seeing two methods whose name differs only by case As noted above, in the \"for C#\" and \"for VB\" versions of the MPXJ DLL, getters and setters have been replaced by properties. For example, where you would have previously written code like this: String text = task . getText (); task . setText ( text ); Now when you work with the \"for C#\" and \"for VB\" versions of the MPXJ DLL, you'll be able to write code in a more familiar style: String text = task . Text task . Text = text ; Also noted above, in the case of the \"for C#\" MPXJ DLL, method names have been modified to begin with an initial capital, so the code will again have a more familiar style. For example, using the original Java method names you'd write something like this: Task task = projectFile . addTask (); Using the \"for C#\" DLL your code will look like this: Task task = projectFile . AddTask (); MPXJ dependencies Once you have selected the version of the MPXJ DLL most suitable for your project, you will need to add its dependencies. If you are using NuGet to manage your dependencies, this is done for you automatically. If you are managing the dependencies manually, the files you need will all be in the relevant sub folder with the src.net\\lib folder of the MPXJ distribution. .Net samples MPXJ ships with some sample files which can be found in the src.net\\samples folder of the distribution. These files illustrate how the MPXJ API can be used to manipulate project data. In particular the MpxjQuery example shows how various elements which make up the project data can be queried. Two versions of this utility are present in src.net\\samples , one written in C#, and the other written in Visual Basic (VB) to illustrate the basics of using MPXJ in either language. Even if you are developing software in a .Net language you may still find it useful to refer to the Java examples, and indeed the original Java source of MPXJ, to give you an insight into how the API can be used. .Net and Java types The .Net version of MPXJ has been generated directly from the Java version using a tool called IKVM. One of the side effects of using IKVM to perform this conversion is that the MPXJ exposes .Net versions of the original Java data types, so for example you will find that the API returns a type called Date rather than a .Net DateTime , and collections which don't expose the familiar IEnumerable interface. To simplify the translation between Java and .Net types, a set of extension methods have been provided. These are included n the NuGet package, and the source can be found in the src.net\\utilities folder, in a project called MpxjUtilities . This project contains extension methods which enhance both Java and .Net classes to make it easier to pass data to and from the API. For example the extension method ToIEnumerable is added to Java collection data types which allows them to be iterated using the familiar foreach .Net syntax. To use these extension methods, simply add a reference to the MpxjUtilities assembly in your own project. The methods themselves are documented in the source, and examples of their use can be seen in the samples provided in the src.net\\samples folder. MPXJ and the GAC For your convenience two batch files are provided in the src.net\\lib\\net45 directory: mpxj-gac-install.bat and mpxj-gac-uninstall.bat . These batch files install the MPXJ assemblies into the GAC and uninstall the MPXJ assemblies from the GAC using the gacutil global assembly cache tool.

This project contains extension methods which enhance both Java and .Net classes to make it easier to pass data to and from the API. For example the extension method ToIEnumerable is added to Java collection data types which allows them to be iterated using the familiar foreach .Net syntax. To use these extension methods, simply add a reference to the MpxjUtilities assembly in your own project. The methods themselves are documented in the source, and examples of their use can be seen in the samples provided in the src.net\\samples folder.","title":".Net and Java types"},{"location":"howto-dotnet/#mpxj-and-the-gac","text":"For your convenience two batch files are provided in the src.net\\lib\\net45 directory: mpxj-gac-install.bat and mpxj-gac-uninstall.bat .

Versions of Microsoft Project after 2003 can import projects from MPD databases but cannot create or write to them. Project 98 crates a database with a schema known as MPD8, which MPXJ does not currently support reading. Project 2000 onward uses a schema call MPD9 which MPXJ can read. Coincidentally, Microsoft Project Server originally shared the same database schema as the MPD9 file format. This means that the MPDDatabaseReader class may also be used to read data from a Project Server SQL Server database. Reading MPD files The simplest way to read an MPD file is to use the UniversalProjectReader : import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile ; import net.sf.mpxj.reader.UniversalProjectReader ; // ... UniversalProjectReader reader = new UniversalProjectReader (); ProjectFile project = reader . read ( \"my-sample.mpd\" ); In order for this to work the UniversalProjectReader assumes that the JDBC-ODBC bridge driver is available. As an MPD file can contain multiple projects, the UniversalProjectReader assumes that a single project is present in the file with an ID of 1. This is normally the case when a single project is saved as an MPD file. Using MPDDatabaseReader You can work directly with the MPDDatabaseReader class by replacing UniversalProjectReader with MPDDatabaseReader . This provides access to additional options, as described below. Setting the database connection Three read methods are provided by the MPDDatabaseReader class which allow you to work directly with an MPD file, either by passing in a file name a File instance or an InputStream instance. These methods use the JDBC-ODBC bridge driver to open the database. An alternative approach is for you to provide your own database connection. To that end the MPDDatabaseReader class provides two additional methods: setConnection and setDataSource which allows you to supply a JDBC Connection instance or a JDBC DataSource instance. You can of course use this to set up your own JDBC connection to read from the MDB file, however these methods may be more useful if you wish to read data from a Microsoft Project Server database instance, which shares the same schema as the MDB file. Selecting a project If the MPD file contains multiple projects, you can retrieve details of the available projects using the listProjects method. This returns a map of project IDs and project names.

Java The example below illustrates how to do this for a Primavera database hosted in SQL Server, using the open source JTDS JDBC driver. The only difference when reading from an Oracle database will be the JDBC driver and connection string used. import java.sql.Connection ; import java.sql.DriverManager ; import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile ; import net.sf.mpxj.primavera.PrimaveraDatabaseReader ; // ... // // Load the JDBC driver // String driverClass = \"net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc.Driver\" ; Class . forName ( driverClass ); // // Open a database connection.

This is easier to achieve as a specific reader class has been created which manages the database connection for you: import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile ; import net.sf.mpxj.primavera.PrimaveraDatabaseFileReader ; ... PrimaveraDatabaseFileReader reader = new PrimaveraDatabaseFileReader (); // // Retrieve a list of the projects available in the database // Map < Integer , String > projects = reader . listProjects ( \"PPMDBSQLite.db\" ); // // At this point you'll select the project // you want to work with. // // // Now open the selected project using its ID // int selectedProjectID = 1 ; reader . setProjectID ( selectedProjectID ); ProjectFile projectFile = reader . read ( \"PPMDBSQLite.db\" ); .Net The situation is a little more complicated when using the .Net version of MPXJ. In this case you are still actually running Java code, so you need to use a JDBC driver to establish a database connection. Your first step will be to convert your JDBC driver to a .Net assembly using IKVM. For example the command line below converts a version of Microsoft's SQL Server JDBC driver to a .Net assembly: c:\\java\\ikvm-8.0.5449.1\\bin\\ikvmc.exe -out:mssql-jdbc-6.4.0.jre8.dll -target:library -keyfile:c:\\java\\mpxj\\src.net\\mpxj.snk -version:6.4.0.0 mssql-jdbc-6.4.0.jre8.jar You can then add a reference to this assembly to your project. Configuring the JDBC driver needs to be done in a slightly different way than you would when using Java. Here we need to create an instance of the JDBC driver class directly, rather than referencing it by name as we would in Java. // // Configure the connection // var driver = new SQLServerDriver (); var connectionProperties = new Properties (); var connection = driver . connect ( connectionString , connectionProperties ); // // Configure the reader // var reader = new PrimaveraDatabaseReader (); reader . Connection = connection ; You can find the complete code for this here . Using PrimaveraDatabaseReader This section documents the additional options provided by the PrimaveraDatabaseReader. Activity WBS In the original implementation of the database handling code, MPXJ would assign each task representing a Primavera Activity its own distinct WBS value. This does not match Primavera's behaviour where all of a WBS element's child activities will have the same WBS value as the parent WBS element. MPXJ's default behaviour now matches Primavera, but should you wish to you can revert to the original behaviour by calling the setMatchPrimaveraWBS as shown below. import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile ; import net.sf.mpxj.primavera.PrimaveraDatabaseReader ; // ... PrimaveraDatabaseReader reader = new PrimaveraDatabaseReader (); reader . setMatchPrimaveraWBS ( false ); WBS is Full Path Currently, the WBS attribute of summary tasks (WBS entities in P6) will be a dot separated hierarchy of all the parent WBS attributes. In this example, root.wbs1.wbs2 is the WBS attribute for wbs2 which has the parents root and wbs1 . To disable this behaviour, and simply record the code for the current WBS entry (in the example above wbs2 ) call the setWbsIsFullPath method, passing in false , as illustrated below. import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile ; import net.sf.mpxj.primavera.PrimaveraDatabaseReader ; // ... PrimaveraDatabaseReader reader = new PrimaveraDatabaseReader (); reader . setWbsIsFullPath ( false ); User Defined Fields MPXJ attempts to map user defined fields from P6 to the custom fields. When MPXJ reads user defined fields from the database, it will assign each new user defined field to a new custom attribute. For example when the first custom text field is read, it will be stored in TEXT1, the next custom text field will be stored in TEXT2, and so on. It is possible that there are more user defined values in the database than there are custom attributes of a specific type in the MPXJ data model. For example the task entity only has TEXT to TEXT30 attributes, so if the database has more than 30 text user defined attributes, the default mapping switches to using ENTERPRISE_TEXT fields. The list below shows the default mappings used by MPXJ. Where there is more than one item shown for each user defined type, this indicates how MPXJ \"overflows\" from one custom type to another. FT_TEXT: TEXT, ENTERPRISE_TEXT FT_START_DATE: START FT_END_DATE: FINISH FT_FLOAT_2_DECIMALS: NUMBER, ENTERPRISE_NUMBER FT_INT: NUMBER, ENTERPRISE_NUMBER FT_STATICTYPE: TEXT, ENTERPRISE_TEXT FT_MONEY: COST, ENTERPRISE_COST You can modify the default mappings used between P6 user defined fields and MPXJ custom fields using the methods shown in the code sample below: import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile ; import net.sf.mpxj.primavera.PrimaveraDatabaseReader ; ... PrimaveraDatabaseReader reader = new PrimaveraDatabaseReader (); reader . setFieldNamesForTaskUdfType ( UserFieldDataType . FT_TEXT , \"ENTERPRISE_TEXT\" , \"TEXT\" ); reader . setFieldNamesForResourceUdfType ( UserFieldDataType . FT_START_DATE , \"DATE\" ); reader . setFieldNamesForAssignmentUdfType ( UserFieldDataType . FT_END_DATE , \"DATE\" ); As the sample shows, a method is provided for the three main entity types: tasks, resources and resource assignments. The first argument you pass to these methods is the P6 user defined field type, followed by a list of names, for example to use the fields DATE1, DATE2 and so on in MPXJ, you would pass in \"DATE\" . To allow values to overflow from one custom field type to another, you can simply pass additional values (see the setFieldNamesForTaskUdfType example above). Reading Additional Attributes A data-driven approach is used to extract the attributes used by MPXJ from the database. You can if you wish change the way attributes are read from the file, or add support for additional attributes. This assumes that you know the column name of the attributes you want to work with in the database. To make changes you will need to retrieve the maps which define which MPXJ attributes are used to store which columns from the database: PrimaveraDatabaseReader reader = new PrimaveraDatabaseReader (); Map < FieldType , String > resourceFieldMap = reader . getResourceFieldMap (); Map < FieldType , String > wbsFieldMap = reader . getWbsFieldMap (); Map < FieldType , String > activityFieldMap = reader . getActivityFieldMap (); Map < FieldType , String > assignmentFieldMap = reader . getAssignmentFieldMap (); These maps will contain the default mapping between columns and MPXJ attributes. You can modify these existing mappings, or add new ones, for example: // // Change the field used to store rsrc_id // activityFieldMap . remove ( TaskField . NUMBER1 ); activityFieldMap . put ( TaskField . NUMBER2 , \"rsrc_id\" ); // // Read an Activity column called an_example_field and store it in TEXT10 // activityFieldMap . put ( TaskField .

Although an XML file format (PMXML) is now also supported, the XER file format is still widely used. Reading XER files The simplest way to read an XER file is to use the UniversalProjectReader : import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile ; import net.sf.mpxj.reader.UniversalProjectReader ; // ... UniversalProjectReader reader = new UniversalProjectReader (); ProjectFile project = reader . read ( \"my-sample.xer\" ); Using PrimaveraXERFileReader You can work directly with the PrimaveraXERFileReader class by replacing UniversalProjectReader with PrimaveraXERFileReader . This provides access to additional options, as described below. Encoding By default MPXJ assumes that XER files are encoded using Windows-1252. The UniversalProjectReader understands Unicode Byte Order Marks (BOM) and will adjust the encoding appropriately if a BOM is present. If you have an XER file with an unusual encoding, you can manually set the encoding used by the reader. Two methods are provided to do this: setCharset and setEncoding . The setCharset method takes an instance of the Charset class, while the setEncoding method takes the name of an encoding. Examples of these methods are shown below: import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile ; import net.sf.mpxj.primavera.PrimaveraXERFileReader ; // ... PrimaveraXERFileReader reader = new PrimaveraXERFileReader (); // Use a Charset instance reader . setCharset ( Charset . forName ( \"GB2312\" )); ProjectFile project = reader . read ( \"my-sample.xer\" ); // Use an encoding name reader . setEncoding ( \"GB2312\" ); project = reader . read ( \"my-sample.xer\" ); Multiple Projects An XER file can contain multiple projects. By default MPXJ reads the first project it finds in the file which has been marked as the \"exported\" project, otherwise it will simply read the first project it finds. You can however use MPXJ to list the projects contained in an XER file, as shown below: import net.sf.mpxj.primavera.PrimaveraXERFileReader ; // ... PrimaveraXERFileReader reader = new PrimaveraXERFileReader (); FileInputStream is = new FileInputStream ( \"my-sample.xer\" ); Map < Integer , String > projects = reader . listProjects ( is ); System . out . println ( \"ID\\tName\" ); for ( Entry < Integer , String > entry : projects . entrySet ()) { System . out . println ( entry . getKey () + \"\\t\" + entry . getValue ()); } The call to listProjects returns a Map whose key is the project ID, and the values are project short names. Once you have decided which of these projects you want to work with, you can call setProjectID to tell the reader which project to open, as shown below. import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile ; import net.sf.mpxj.primavera.PrimaveraXERFileReader ; // ... PrimaveraXERFileReader reader = new PrimaveraXERFileReader (); reader . setProjectID ( 123 ); ProjectFile file = reader . read ( \"my-sample.xer\" ); Alternatively you can ask MPXJ to read all of the projects contained in the file: import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile ; import net.sf.mpxj.primavera.PrimaveraXERFileReader ; // ... PrimaveraXERFileReader reader = new PrimaveraXERFileReader (); InputStream is = new FileInputStream ( \"my-sample.xer\" ); List < ProjectFile > files = reader . readAll ( is ); The call to the readAll method returns a list of ProjectFile instances corresponding to the projects in the XER file. Link Cross-Project Relations An XER file can contain multiple projects with relations between activities which span those projects. By default these cross-project relations are ignored. However, if you set the linkCrossProjectRelations reader attribute to true , MPXJ will attempt to link these relations across projects: import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile ; import net.sf.mpxj.primavera.PrimaveraXERFileReader ; // ... PrimaveraXERFileReader reader = new PrimaveraXERFileReader (); reader . setLinkCrossProjectRelations ( true ); InputStream is = new FileInputStream ( \"my-sample.xer\" ); List < ProjectFile > files = reader . readAll ( is ); Activity WBS In the original implementation of the XER file handling code, MPXJ would assign each task representing a Primavera Activity its own distinct WBS value. This does not match Primavera's behaviour where all of a WBS element's child activities will have the same WBS value as the parent WBS element. MPXJ's default behaviour now matches Primavera, but should you wish to you can revert to the original behaviour by calling the setMatchPrimaveraWBS as shown below. import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile ; import net.sf.mpxj.primavera.PrimaveraXERFileReader ; // ... PrimaveraXERFileReader reader = new PrimaveraXERFileReader (); reader . setMatchPrimaveraWBS ( false ); ProjectFile file = reader . read ( \"my-sample.xer\" ); WBS is Full Path Currently the WBS attribute of summary tasks (WBS entities in P6) will be a dot separated hierarchy of all of the parent WBS attributes. In this example, root.wbs1.wbs2 is the WBS attribute for wbs2 which has the parents root and wbs1 . To disable this behaviour, and simply record the code for the current WBS entry (in the example above wbs2 ) call the setWbsIsFullPath method, passing in false , as illustrated below. import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile ; import net.sf.mpxj.primavera.PrimaveraXERFileReader ; // ... PrimaveraXERFileReader reader = new PrimaveraXERFileReader (); reader . setWbsIsFullPath ( false ); User Defined Fields MPXJ attempts to map user defined fields from P6 to the custom fields. When MPXJ reads user defined fields from the XER file, it will assign each new user defined field to a new custom attribute. For example when the first custom text field is read, it will be stored in TEXT1, the next custom text field will be stored in TEXT2, and so on. It is possible that there are more user defined values in the XER file than there are custom attributes of a specific type in the MPXJ data model. For example the task entity only has TEXT to TEXT30 attributes, so if the XER file has more than 30 text user defined attributes, the default mapping switches to using ENTERPRISE_TEXT fields. The list below shows the default mappings used by MPXJ. Where there is more than one item shown for each user defined type, this indicates how MPXJ \"overflows\" from one custom type to another. FT_TEXT: TEXT, ENTERPRISE_TEXT FT_START_DATE: START FT_END_DATE: FINISH FT_FLOAT_2_DECIMALS: NUMBER, ENTERPRISE_NUMBER FT_INT: NUMBER, ENTERPRISE_NUMBER FT_STATICTYPE: TEXT, ENTERPRISE_TEXT FT_MONEY: COST, ENTERPRISE_COST You can modify the default mappings used between P6 user defined fields and MPXJ custom fields using the methods shown in the code sample below: import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile ; import net.sf.mpxj.primavera.PrimaveraXERFileReader ; // ... PrimaveraXERFileReader reader = new PrimaveraXERFileReader (); reader . setFieldNamesForTaskUdfType ( UserFieldDataType . FT_TEXT , \"ENTERPRISE_TEXT\" , \"TEXT\" ); reader . setFieldNamesForResourceUdfType ( UserFieldDataType . FT_START_DATE , \"DATE\" ); reader . setFieldNamesForAssignmentUdfType ( UserFieldDataType . FT_END_DATE , \"DATE\" ); ProjectFile file = reader . read ( \"my-sample.xer\" ); As the sample shows, a method is provided for the three main entity types: tasks, resources and resource assignments. The first argument you pass to these methods is the P6 user defined field type, followed by a list of names, for example to use the fields DATE1, DATE2 and so on in MPXJ, you would pass in \"DATE\" . To allow values to overflow from one custom field type to another, you can simply pass additional values (see the setFieldNamesForTaskUdfType example above). Reading Additional Attributes A data-driven approach is used to extract the attributes used by MPXJ from the XER file. You can if you wish change the way attributes are read from the file, or add support for additional attributes. This assumes that you know the column name of the attributes you want to work with in the XER file. To make changes you will need to retrieve the maps which define which MPXJ attributes are used to store which columns from the XER file: PrimaveraXERFileReader reader = new PrimaveraXERFileReader (); Map < FieldType , String > resourceFieldMap = reader . getResourceFieldMap (); Map < FieldType , String > wbsFieldMap = reader . getWbsFieldMap (); Map < FieldType , String > activityFieldMap = reader . getActivityFieldMap (); Map < FieldType , String > assignmentFieldMap = reader . getAssignmentFieldMap (); These maps will contain the default mapping between columns and MPXJ attributes. You can modify these existing mappings, or add new ones, for example: // // Change the field used to store rsrc_id // activityFieldMap . remove ( TaskField . NUMBER1 ); activityFieldMap . put ( TaskField . NUMBER2 , \"rsrc_id\" ); // // Read an Activity column called an_example_field and store it in TEXT10 // activityFieldMap . put ( TaskField . TEXT10 , \"an_example_field\" ); When reading new columns from the XER file, if these columns have a type other than String, it is important to register the type of the column to ensure that it is converted correctly. You will also need to ensure that the MPXJ attribute you are writing this new value to can receive the data type you are assigning to it (for example, you must store a date in a date attribute, you can't store a date in an integer attribute). For example, if we are reading an integer column called an_example_id and store it in the NUMBER2 attribute, we will need to take the following steps: PrimaveraXERFileReader reader = new PrimaveraXERFileReader (); Map < String , XerFieldType > fieldTypeMap = reader . getFieldTypeMap (); fieldTypeMap . put ( \"an_example_id\" , XerFieldType . INTEGER ); Map < FieldType , String > activityFieldMap = reader . getActivityFieldMap (); activityFieldMap . put ( TaskField .

It is possible that there are more user defined values in the XER file than there are custom attributes of a specific type in the MPXJ data model. For example the task entity only has TEXT to TEXT30 attributes, so if the XER file has more than 30 text user defined attributes, the default mapping switches to using ENTERPRISE_TEXT fields. The list below shows the default mappings used by MPXJ. Where there is more than one item shown for each user defined type, this indicates how MPXJ \"overflows\" from one custom type to another.

You can if you wish change the way attributes are read from the file, or add support for additional attributes.

To make changes you will need to retrieve the maps which define which MPXJ attributes are used to store which columns from the XER file: PrimaveraXERFileReader reader = new PrimaveraXERFileReader (); Map < FieldType , String > resourceFieldMap = reader . getResourceFieldMap (); Map < FieldType , String > wbsFieldMap = reader . getWbsFieldMap (); Map < FieldType , String > activityFieldMap = reader . getActivityFieldMap (); Map < FieldType , String > assignmentFieldMap = reader . getAssignmentFieldMap (); These maps will contain the default mapping between columns and MPXJ attributes.

MPXJ is based around a \"neutral\" data structure which is used to represent project data, coupled with a set of format-specific reader and writer classes which understand how to read from and write to the various supported file formats. The diagram below illustrates the key entities represented by the MPXJ data structure. MPXJ currently allows project data to be read from a wide variety of schedule file formats and databases. You can find details of the individual file formats supported elsewhere in the documentation. By far the easiest way to read schedule data is to use the \"universal project reader\" which can determine for itself the type of file you have passed to it. ProjectReader reader = new UniversalProjectReader (); ProjectFile project = reader . read ( \"example.mpp\" ); A similar arrangement exists for the writer classes, although there is not a \"universal project writer\" as such: net.sf.mpxj.mpx.MPXWriter : writes Microsoft MPX files net.sf.mpxj.mspdi.MSPDIWriter : writes Microsoft MSPDI (XML) files net.sf.mpxj.primavera.PrimaveraPMFileWriter : writes Primavera PMXML (XML) files net.sf.mpxj.planner.PlannerWriter : writes Planner (XML) files net.sf.mpxj.json.JsonWriter : writes JSON files (primarily used to support the Ruby version of MPXJ) All of these classes implement the ProjectWriter interface. If you know which type of file you are working with, you can use these writers directly, for example: ProjectWriter writer = new MPXWriter (); writer . write ( project , \"example.mpx\" ); Tasks and Resources Once you've read your project file, what next? The first things of interest are the tasks and resources which are present in the file. ProjectReader reader = new UniversalProjectReader (); ProjectFile project = reader . read ( \"example.mpp\" ); for ( Resource resource : project . getAllResources ()) { System . out . println ( \"Resource: \" + resource . getName () + \" (Unique ID=\" + resource . getUniqueID () + \")\" ); } The code fragment above shows how we can retrieve a collection containing all of the resources present in the file, and iterate through them printing the resource name, ID and unique ID. Many of the entities represented in MPXJ have some concept of a unique ID. Tasks and resources have two ID fields, the unique ID, which as its name suggests never changes and uniquely identifies a task or a resource, and the ID. The ID of a task or a resource is the sequential number which typically appears next to the task or resource when displayed in Microsoft Project. If the task or resource is moved up or down the list, this number will change depending on the position in the list. The unique ID never changes. ProjectReader reader = new UniversalProjectReader (); ProjectFile project = reader . read ( \"example.mpp\" ); for ( Task task : project . getAllTasks ()) { System . out . println ( \"Task: \" + task . getName () + \" ID=\" + task . getID () + \" Unique ID=\" + task . getUniqueID ()); } The code fragment above retrieves all tasks present in the file and prints details of their names, IDs, and unique IDs. Methods are provided on the project to locate both tasks and resource using either their ID or their Unique ID, as the examples below illustrate. Resource r = project . getResourceByUniqueID ( Integer . valueOf ( 99 )); Task t = project . getTaskByUniqueID ( Integer . valueOf ( 99 )); The methods shown above for retrieving all tasks present in a project file ignores the hierarchical task structure which Microsoft Project allows users to create. To understand the hierarchical task structure, the following methods are used to descend through the hierarchy, starting from the top. List < Task > tasks = project . getChildTasks (); Task task = tasks . get ( 0 ); tasks = task . getChildTasks (); These methods are used in the following code fragment to print out an indented list representing the task hierarchy in the file. public void listHierarchy ( ProjectFile file ) { for ( Task task : file . getChildTasks ()) { System . out . println ( \"Task: \" + task . getName ()); listHierarchy ( task , \" \" ); } System . out . println (); } private void listHierarchy ( Task task , String indent ) { for ( Task child : task . getChildTasks ()) { System . out . println ( indent + \"Task: \" + child . getName ()); listHierarchy ( child , indent + \" \" ); } } As well as the hierarchical relationships between tasks, there is also a temporal relationship between them: this is typically used to indicate when a task can start in relation to the completion of an earlier task. The code fragment below shows the predecessor relationships between tasks. for ( Task task : file . getAllTasks ()) { List < Relation > predecessors = task . getPredecessors (); if ( predecessors != null && ! predecessors . isEmpty ()) { System . out . println ( task . getName () + \" predecessors:\" ); for ( Relation relation : predecessors ) { System . out . println ( \" Task: \" + file . getTaskByUniqueID ( relation . getTaskUniqueID ()). getName ()); System . out . println ( \" Type: \" + relation . getType ()); System . out . println ( \" Lag: \" + relation . getDuration ()); } } } Resource Assignments Tasks and resources are related by resource assignments. There is a method available on the ProjectFile class which will retrieve all resource assignments in the file. This is used by the code fragment below to provide an overview of all assignments. for ( ResourceAssignment assignment : file . getAllResourceAssignments ()) { Task task = assignment . getTask (); String taskName ; if ( task == null ) { taskName = \"(null task)\" ; } else { taskName = task . getName (); } Resource resource = assignment . getResource (); String resourceName ; if ( resource == null ) { resourceName = \"(null resource)\" ; } else { resourceName = resource . getName (); } System . out . println ( \"Assignment: Task=\" + taskName + \" Resource=\" + resourceName ); } Resource assignments can also be retrieved on a task-by-task basis, as the code fragment below illustrates. for ( Task task : file . getAllTasks ()) { System . out . println ( \"Assignments for task \" + task . getName () + \":\" ); for ( ResourceAssignment assignment : task . getResourceAssignments ()) { Resource resource = assignment . getResource (); String resourceName ; if ( resource == null ) { resourceName = \"(null resource)\" ; } else { resourceName = resource . getName (); } System . out . println ( \" \" + resourceName ); } } Finally, resource assignments can be viewed on a resource-by-resource basis, as the following code fragment shows. for ( Resource resource : file . getAllResources ()) { System . out . println ( \"Assignments for resource \" + resource . getName () + \":\" ); for ( ResourceAssignment assignment : resource . getTaskAssignments ()) { Task task = assignment . getTask (); System . out . println ( \" \" + task . getName ()); } } Calendars Calendars are used to define working and non-working time, and are one of the more complex structures defined as part of a project. They are in turn used to define the time period over which a task is scheduled. There are two types of calendar: base calendars and resource calendars. Each base calendar provides a complete definition of the working and non working time for each day of the week. Resource calendars are associated with individual resources. Each resource calendar is derived from a base calendar; resource calendars may be unmodified in which case it will appear to be identical to the underlying base calendar, or the resource calendar may modify the working and non-working days. In this case these changes are \"overlaid\" on top of the working and non-working times defined by the base calendar. The calendars defined in a project can be retrieved using the method call shown below. List < ProjectCalendar > calendars = file . getCalendars (); Normally a task without resource assignments will be scheduled with reference to the \"Standard\" (default) calendar defined as part of the project. This is retrieved using the method calls shown below. ProjectCalendar defaultCalendar = file . getDefaultCalendar (); It is also possible to associate a specific calendar with an individual task. The method call below shows the calendar associated with a task being retrieved. ProjectCalendar taskCalendar = task . getCalendar (); Bearing in mind that one calendar may be derived from another, care must be taken when choosing the methods called on a calendar instance: some methods are used to retrieve attributes defined as part of that specific calendar only, while others are used to descend through the hierarchy of calendars until an \"actual\" value is retrieved. For example the getDays method will retrieve an array of flags indicating the working/non-working/default state of each day of the week as defined by the current calendar. The getDay method however will test the current calendar to see if it is a working or non-working day. If the flag in the current calendar is set to \"default\", the method will use the base calendar from which the current calendar is derived to determine if the day is working or non-working. As noted above a calendar contains a set of flags which represent each day of the week, these indicate the day of the week is working non-working, or \"default\". Where a day is set as \"default\", the working time for that day is taken from the underlying base calendar, if it is a resource calendar, or uses the default values provided by Microsoft Project if it is a base calendar. If a particular day is defined as a working day, then the calendar will also contain a set of working hours for that day. The working hours for a day are defined by an instance of the ProjectCalendarHours class. This contains a collection of DateRange instances which defined the start and end times of each working period during the day. Alongside the flags which control whether a day is working or non-working, and the working hours for each day, each calendar defines a set of exceptions which are used to \"override\" the default working or non-working hours for individual days or entire date ranges. Methods are provided to allow a list of all exceptions defined by a calendar can be retrieved, or to retrieve the exception which covers an individual date. Calendar exceptions are represented by instances of the ProjectCalendarException class. Timephased Data Although resource assignments on their own describe which resources are assigned to which tasks, and how much work they are going to do, this does not necessarily tell us how much work a resource will be doing on any particular date. In order to find this information, you will need to consult the timephased resource assignment data. Each resource assignment has a pair of methods allowing you to retrieve timephased data, as shown by the example code below. List < TimephasedResourceAssignment > planned = assignment . getTimephasedPlanned (); List < TimephasedResourceAssignment > complete = assignment . getTimephasedComplete (); Timephased resource assignment data is represented by instances of the TimephasedResourceAssignment class. This class is designed to provide a compact representation of the work carried out over ranges of days, rather than having to represent the work carried out on each individual day using a single class instance per day. Each TimephasedResourceAssignment defines four attributes: a start date, an end date, a total amount of work, and an amount of work per day. For example, you may retrieve an instance of the TimephasedResourceAssignment class whose start and end date defines a five day period. The total work for the period is 40 hours, and the work per day is defined as 8 hours. This indicates that for the period in question, on each working day within the date range, 8 hours of work will be carried out. It is important to remember that non-working days are ignored, so for example if we have a 7 day period which spans a weekend, the total work could still be 40 hours, and the work per day 8 hours: only the 5 working days are allocated work, the non-working weekend days have zero hours of work performed. The two lists defined above will contain multiple TimephasedResourceAssignment instances where different numbers of hours are worked on different days. Each contiguous range of dates where the same number of hours are worked in a day will be represented by one TimephasedResourceAssignment instance. The two lists of timephased data represent completed (actual) work, and planned work respectively. These lists may overlap by a single day if they are being used to show a partially completed day's work. For example, during a normal 8 hour working day, if 4 hours of work has been completed, and 4 hours remains, then the list of completed timephased data will end with 4 hours of work which have been completed, and the planned work list will start with the 4 hours remaining on the same day.","title":"MPXJ Basics"},{"location":"howto-start/#mpxj-basics","text":"The MPXJ library allows various formats of Microsoft Project file formats, and file formats from other project planning applications to be read and written using a single consistent API in Java, .Net, Python or any other related languages, and provides read-only access as a Ruby gem.

They are in turn used to define the time period over which a task is scheduled. There are two types of calendar: base calendars and resource calendars. Each base calendar provides a complete definition of the working and non working time for each day of the week. Resource calendars are associated with individual resources. Each resource calendar is derived from a base calendar; resource calendars may be unmodified in which case it will appear to be identical to the underlying base calendar, or the resource calendar may modify the working and non-working days. In this case these changes are \"overlaid\" on top of the working and non-working times defined by the base calendar. The calendars defined in a project can be retrieved using the method call shown below. List < ProjectCalendar > calendars = file . getCalendars (); Normally a task without resource assignments will be scheduled with reference to the \"Standard\" (default) calendar defined as part of the project. This is retrieved using the method calls shown below. ProjectCalendar defaultCalendar = file . getDefaultCalendar (); It is also possible to associate a specific calendar with an individual task. The method call below shows the calendar associated with a task being retrieved. ProjectCalendar taskCalendar = task . getCalendar (); Bearing in mind that one calendar may be derived from another, care must be taken when choosing the methods called on a calendar instance: some methods are used to retrieve attributes defined as part of that specific calendar only, while others are used to descend through the hierarchy of calendars until an \"actual\" value is retrieved. For example the getDays method will retrieve an array of flags indicating the working/non-working/default state of each day of the week as defined by the current calendar. The getDay method however will test the current calendar to see if it is a working or non-working day. If the flag in the current calendar is set to \"default\", the method will use the base calendar from which the current calendar is derived to determine if the day is working or non-working. As noted above a calendar contains a set of flags which represent each day of the week, these indicate the day of the week is working non-working, or \"default\". Where a day is set as \"default\", the working time for that day is taken from the underlying base calendar, if it is a resource calendar, or uses the default values provided by Microsoft Project if it is a base calendar. If a particular day is defined as a working day, then the calendar will also contain a set of working hours for that day. The working hours for a day are defined by an instance of the ProjectCalendarHours class. This contains a collection of DateRange instances which defined the start and end times of each working period during the day. Alongside the flags which control whether a day is working or non-working, and the working hours for each day, each calendar defines a set of exceptions which are used to \"override\" the default working or non-working hours for individual days or entire date ranges. Methods are provided to allow a list of all exceptions defined by a calendar can be retrieved, or to retrieve the exception which covers an individual date. Calendar exceptions are represented by instances of the ProjectCalendarException class.","title":"Calendars"},{"location":"howto-start/#timephased-data","text":"Although resource assignments on their own describe which resources are assigned to which tasks, and how much work they are going to do, this does not necessarily tell us how much work a resource will be doing on any particular date. In order to find this information, you will need to consult the timephased resource assignment data. Each resource assignment has a pair of methods allowing you to retrieve timephased data, as shown by the example code below. List < TimephasedResourceAssignment > planned = assignment . getTimephasedPlanned (); List < TimephasedResourceAssignment > complete = assignment . getTimephasedComplete (); Timephased resource assignment data is represented by instances of the TimephasedResourceAssignment class. This class is designed to provide a compact representation of the work carried out over ranges of days, rather than having to represent the work carried out on each individual day using a single class instance per day. Each TimephasedResourceAssignment defines four attributes: a start date, an end date, a total amount of work, and an amount of work per day. For example, you may retrieve an instance of the TimephasedResourceAssignment class whose start and end date defines a five day period. The total work for the period is 40 hours, and the work per day is defined as 8 hours. This indicates that for the period in question, on each working day within the date range, 8 hours of work will be carried out. It is important to remember that non-working days are ignored, so for example if we have a 7 day period which spans a weekend, the total work could still be 40 hours, and the work per day 8 hours: only the 5 working days are allocated work, the non-working weekend days have zero hours of work performed. The two lists defined above will contain multiple TimephasedResourceAssignment instances where different numbers of hours are worked on different days. Each contiguous range of dates where the same number of hours are worked in a day will be represented by one TimephasedResourceAssignment instance. The two lists of timephased data represent completed (actual) work, and planned work respectively. These lists may overlap by a single day if they are being used to show a partially completed day's work. For example, during a normal 8 hour working day, if 4 hours of work has been completed, and 4 hours remains, then the list of completed timephased data will end with 4 hours of work which have been completed, and the planned work list will start with the 4 hours remaining on the same day.","title":"Timephased Data"},{"location":"howto-use-calendars/","text":"How To: Use Calendars Calendars are the foundation on which schedules are built. They determine when work can be carried out, and when work is not possible. Given some tasks we need to plan, and knowing how much work each task will require, a calendar can be used to decide when work on each task could start and how much elapsed time will be required to complete the tasks. Calendars in MPXJ Let's see how calendars work in MPXJ. First let's try creating one. As it happens, the ProjectFile class provides a convenience method addDefaultBaseCalendar to create a default calendar. The calendar it creates is modelled on the Standard calendar you'd see in Microsoft Project if you created a new project. This default calendar defines Monday to Friday as working days, with 8 working hours each day (8am to noon, then 1pm to 5pm). ProjectFile file = new ProjectFile (); ProjectCalendar calendar = file . addDefaultBaseCalendar (); System . out . println ( \"The calendar name is \" + calendar . getName ()); As you can see from the code above, the calendar also has a name which we can set to distinguish between different calendars. Working Days Let's see what the calendar can tell us. First we'll use the Day enumeration to retrieve the working/non-working state for each day. for ( Day day : Day . values ()) { String dayType = calendar . getCalendarDayType ( day ). toString (); System . out . println ( day + \" is a \" + dayType + \" day\" ); } Running the code shown above will produce output like this: SUNDAY is a NON_WORKING day MONDAY is a WORKING day TUESDAY is a WORKING day WEDNESDAY is a WORKING day THURSDAY is a WORKING day FRIDAY is a WORKING day SATURDAY is a NON_WORKING day We can use the setWorkingDay method to change our pattern of working day. Let's make Saturday a working day for our team, and make Monday a non-working day to compensate. calendar . setWorkingDay ( Day . SATURDAY , true ); calendar . setWorkingDay ( Day . MONDAY , false ); Now if we use the loop we saw previously to inspect the week days, we'll see this output: SUNDAY is a NON_WORKING day MONDAY is a NON_WORKING day TUESDAY is a WORKING day WEDNESDAY is a WORKING day THURSDAY is a WORKING day FRIDAY is a WORKING day SATURDAY is a WORKING day Working Hours So far, all we have done is set a flag which tells us whether a day is working or non-working. How do we know the working times on those days? We can use the getCalendarHours method to find that information. The getCalendarHours method returns a List of DateRange instances. DateRange is a simple immutable class which represents a span of time between a start date and an end date as an inclusive range. Let's try printing these DateRange instances to our output to see what we get: List < DateRange > hours = calendar . getCalendarHours ( Day . TUESDAY ); hours . forEach ( System . out :: println ); Here's the output: [DateRange start=Sat Jan 01 08:00:00 GMT 1 end=Sat Jan 01 12:00:00 GMT 1] [DateRange start=Sat Jan 01 13:00:00 GMT 1 end=Sat Jan 01 17:00:00 GMT 1] This isn't quite what we were expecting! What's happening here is that DateRange is using java.util.Date values to represent the start and end of the range, and the toString method of the dateRange class is just using these values directly. As these java.util.Date represent a full timestamp, we're seeing the entire timestamp here in our output. The day, month and year components of the timestamp have been set to a default value (in this case January 1st 0001). As work on MPXJ started in 2002, java.util.Date was the logical choice for representing dates, times and timestamps. Since Java 1.8, LocalTime would probably be a better representation for these values. This is likely to be a future enhancement to MPXJ. Let's add a method to format the hours of a day tidily for display: private String formatDateRanges ( List < DateRange > hours ) { DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat ( \"HH:mm\" ); return hours . stream () . map ( h -> df . format ( h . getStart ()) + \"-\" + df . format ( h . getEnd ())) . collect ( Collectors . joining ( \", \" )); } In a real application we probably wouldn't want to instantiate a new DateFormat each time we call the method, but this is fine as a demonstration. So now our output looks like this: 08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00 Let's use this method to take a look at the whole week again: for ( Day day : Day . values ()) { String dayType = calendar . getCalendarDayType ( day ). toString (); System . out . println ( day + \" is a \" + dayType + \" day (\" + formatDateRanges ( calendar . getCalendarHours ( day )) + \")\" ); } Here's the output: SUNDAY is a NON_WORKING day () MONDAY is a NON_WORKING day () TUESDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) WEDNESDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) THURSDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) FRIDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) SATURDAY is a WORKING day () The one thing we're missing now is that although we have set Saturday to be a working day, it doesn't have any working hours. MPXJ has some constants which can be used to help us add some working hours: hours = calendar . getCalendarHours ( Day . SATURDAY ); hours . add ( ProjectCalendarDays . DEFAULT_WORKING_MORNING ); hours . add ( ProjectCalendarDays . DEFAULT_WORKING_AFTERNOON ); Now when we examine our week this is what we see: SUNDAY is a NON_WORKING day () MONDAY is a NON_WORKING day () TUESDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) WEDNESDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) THURSDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) FRIDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) SATURDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) The version of MPXJ at the time of writing (10.5.0) has a limitation that if setCalendarDayType is used to make a day into a working day, we don't automatically add working hours for it. This behaviour is likely to change with the next major version of MPXJ. What if we want to supply some working hours different from the defaults we've used so far? To set our own working hours we just need to create as many DateRange instances as we need using a pair of Date instances for each one to represent the start and end times. The year, month and day components of each Date are ignored. Here's an example of using Java's Calendar class to set a new working time for Saturday: Calendar javaCalendar = Calendar . getInstance (); javaCalendar . set ( Calendar . HOUR_OF_DAY , 9 ); javaCalendar . set ( Calendar . MINUTE , 0 ); Date startTime = javaCalendar . getTime (); javaCalendar . set ( Calendar . HOUR_OF_DAY , 14 ); javaCalendar . set ( Calendar . MINUTE , 30 ); Date finishTime = javaCalendar . getTime (); hours = calendar . getCalendarHours ( Day . SATURDAY ); hours . clear (); hours . add ( new DateRange ( startTime , finishTime )); Now when we look at the working hours for Saturday, this is what we see: SATURDAY is a WORKING day (09:00-14:30) MPXJ actually provides a helper method to simplify this process, here's the equivalent code: startTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 9 , 0 ); finishTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 14 , 30 ); Now we've seen how we can create our own ranges of working time for a day, let's tackle a slightly more challenging case: dealing with midnight. Our first step is to take a look at the actual amount of working time we've set up on Saturday. To do this we call the getWork method, as shown below. Duration duration = calendar . getWork ( Day . SATURDAY , TimeUnit . HOURS ); System . out . println ( duration ); This getWork method determines the total amount of work on the given day, and returns this in the format we specify. In this case we've asked for hours, and we'll be receiving the result as a Duration object. Duration simply combines the duration amount with an instance of the TimeUnit enumeration so we always know the units of the duration amount. Running the code above give us this output: 5.5h As you can see, the toString method of Duration give us a nicely formatted result, complete with an abbreviation for the units. Let's try to change Saturday to be 24 hour working. First we'll configure a midnight to midnight date range: startTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 0 , 0 ); finishTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 0 , 0 ); hours . clear (); hours . add ( new DateRange ( startTime , finishTime )); System . out . println ( formatDateRanges ( calendar . getCalendarHours ( Day . SATURDAY ))); This looks reasonable: 00:00-00:00 Now let's see how much work this represents: duration = calendar . getWork ( Day . SATURDAY , TimeUnit . HOURS ); System . out . println ( duration ); 0.0h Oh dear, that's not what we're expecting! This is one of the \"gotchas\" of the way MPXJ works presently: if we want to use midnight at the end of a date range, we actually need to explicitly create a time which is \"+1 day\" from our start time. The code below shows how we can do this using Calendar . javaCalendar . set ( Calendar . HOUR_OF_DAY , 0 ); javaCalendar . set ( Calendar . MINUTE , 0 ); startTime = javaCalendar . getTime (); javaCalendar . add ( Calendar . DAY_OF_YEAR , 1 ); finishTime = javaCalendar . getTime (); hours . clear (); hours . add ( new DateRange ( startTime , finishTime )); System . out . println ( formatDateRanges ( calendar . getCalendarHours ( Day . SATURDAY ))); We still end up with a range which looks like this: 00:00-00:00 But crucially now if we re-run the duration calculation, we get: 24.0h So we have our 24 hours of work on Saturday! Exceptions After working a few of these 24 hour days on Saturdays, we might be in need of a vacation! How can we add this to our calendar? So far we've been working with the Day class to make changes to days of the week, rather than any specific date. Now we'll need to work with a specific date, and add an \"exception\" for this date. The terminology here can be slightly confusing when coming from a programming background, but the term exception is often used by scheduling applications in the context of making ad-hoc adjustments to a calendar. DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat ( \"dd/MM/yyyy\" ); Date exceptionDate = df . parse ( \"10/05/2022\" ); boolean workingDate = calendar . isWorkingDate ( exceptionDate ); System . out . println ( df . format ( exceptionDate ) + \" is a \" + ( workingDate ? \"working\" : \"non-working\" ) + \" day\" ); In the code above we're creating a Date instance to represent the date we want to add an exception for. The code uses the isWorkingDate method to determine whether or not the given date is a working day. Before we add the exception, here's the output we get: 10/05/2022 is a working day Now we can create our exception. ProjectCalendarException exception = calendar . addCalendarException ( exceptionDate ); exception . setName ( \"A day off\" ); The code above illustrates adding an exception for a single day. The time component of the Date instance you pass in here is irrelevant, the exception is always effective from the beginning of the day to the end of the day. The code above also shows that optionally an exception can be named, this can make it easier to understand the purpose of each exception. Now if we re-run our code which displays whether our chosen date is a working day, this is what we see: 10/05/2022 is a non-working day We have successfully added an exception to turn this date into a day off! Perhaps we were being a little too generous in giving ourselves the entire day off, perhaps in this case we should make this a half day instead. To do that, we just need to add a time range to the exception: startTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 8 , 0 ); finishTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 12 , 0 ); exception . add ( new DateRange ( startTime , finishTime )); Now if we look at our chosen date, this is what we see: 10/05/2022 is a working day Let's take a closer look at what's happening on that day: System . out . println ( \"Working time on Tuesdays is normally \" + calendar . getWork ( Day . TUESDAY , TimeUnit . HOURS ) + \" but on \" + df . format ( exceptionDate ) + \" it is \" + calendar . getWork ( exceptionDate , TimeUnit . HOURS )); The code above shows how we use the getWork method which takes a Day as an argument to look at what the default working hours are on a Tuesday, then we use the getWork method which takes a Date instance as an argument to see what's happening on the specific Tuesday of our exception. Here's the output we get: Working time on Tuesdays is normally 8.0h but on 10/05/2022 it is 4.0h We can see the effect of adding a DateRange to our exception: we've gone from an exception which changes a working day into a non-working day to an exception which just changes the number of working hours in the day. This same approach can be used to change a date which falls on a day that's typically non-working (for example a Sunday) into a working day, just by adding an exception with some working hours. We can also use a single exception to affect a number of days. First let's write a little code to see the number of working hours over a range of days: Calendar start = Calendar . getInstance (); start . setTime ( df . parse ( \"23/05/2022\" )); Calendar end = Calendar . getInstance (); end . setTime ( df . parse ( \"28/05/2022\" )); for ( Date date = start . getTime (); start . before ( end ); start . add ( Calendar . DATE , 1 ), date = start . getTime ()) { System . out . println ( df . format ( date ) + \"\\t\" + calendar . getWork ( date , TimeUnit . HOURS )); } Running this code with our calendar as its stands produces this output for the example week we're using: 23/05/2022 0.0h 24/05/2022 8.0h 25/05/2022 8.0h 26/05/2022 8.0h 27/05/2022 8.0h Let's add an exception which covers Tuesday to Thursday that week (24th to 26th), and changes the working hours, so there are now only four hours of work per day (9am to 12pm): Date exceptionStartDate = df . parse ( \"24/05/2022\" ); Date exceptionEndDate = df . parse ( \"26/05/2022\" ); exception = calendar . addCalendarException ( exceptionStartDate , exceptionEndDate ); startTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 9 , 0 ); finishTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 13 , 0 ); exception . add ( new DateRange ( startTime , finishTime )); Here we can see that we're using a different version of the addCalendarException method which takes a start and an end date, rather that just a single date. Running our code again to print out the working hours for each day now gives us this output: 23/05/2022 0.0h 24/05/2022 4.0h 25/05/2022 4.0h 26/05/2022 4.0h 27/05/2022 8.0h As we can see, we've changed multiple days with this single exception. Working Weeks So far we've looked at using ProjectCalendarException , which can make one change (add working hours, change working hours, or make days non-working) and apply that change to one day or a contiguous range of days. What if we want to make more complex changes to the working pattern of a calendar? Let's imagine that our project has a three week \"crunch\" period at the beginning of October where we will need to work 16 hour days, Monday through Friday, and 8 hour days at weekends. (I hope this is a fictional example and you'd don't have to work at such a high intensity in real life!). We could construct this work pattern using exceptions: we'd need six in total, one for each of the three sets of weekend days, and one for each of the three sets of week days. An alternative way to do this is to set up a new working week, using the ProjectCalendarWeek class. \"Working Week\" is perhaps a slightly misleading name, as a ProjectCalendarWeek can be set up for an arbitrary range of dates, from a few days to many weeks. What it represents is the pattern of working an non-working time over the seven days of a week, and this pattern is applied from the start to the end of the date range we configure. The ProjectCalendar we've been working with so far is actually already a form of working week (they share a common parent class). The main differences between the two are that a ProjectCalendarWeek allows us to specify the range of dates over which it is effective, and a ProjectCalendarWeek does not have exceptions: exceptions are only added to a ProjectCalendar . Here's how our example looks in code: calendar = file . addDefaultBaseCalendar (); ProjectCalendarWeek week = calendar . addWorkWeek (); week . setName ( \"Crunch Time!\" ); Date weekStart = df . parse ( \"01/10/2022\" ); Date weekEnd = df . parse ( \"21/10/2022\" ); week . setDateRange ( new DateRange ( weekStart , weekEnd )); Arrays . stream ( Day . values ()). forEach ( d -> week . setWorkingDay ( d , true )); For a fresh start, we'll create a new ProjectCalendar instance. With this we'll add a new working week definition and give it a name, to make it easily identifiable. Now we'll set the dates for which this work pattern is valid (in this case the first three weeks of October). Finally we mark every day as a working day. Next we can set up our weekend 9am to 5pm working pattern: startTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 9 , 0 ); finishTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 17 , 0 ); DateRange weekendHours = new DateRange ( startTime , finishTime ); Arrays . asList ( Day . SATURDAY , Day . SUNDAY ) . stream (). forEach ( d -> week . addCalendarHours ( d ). add ( weekendHours )); Finally we can set up our weekday 5am to 9pm pattern: startTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 5 , 0 ); finishTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 21 , 0 ); DateRange weekdayHours = new DateRange ( startTime , finishTime ); Arrays . asList ( Day . MONDAY , Day . TUESDAY , Day . WEDNESDAY , Day . THURSDAY , Day . FRIDAY ) . stream (). forEach ( d -> week . addCalendarHours ( d ). add ( weekdayHours )); As ProjectCalendar and ProjectCalendarWeek are both derived from the same parent class, we can use the same code we did previously to examine how our new ProjectCalendarWeek instance looks: SUNDAY is a WORKING day (09:00-17:00) MONDAY is a WORKING day (05:00-21:00) TUESDAY is a WORKING day (05:00-21:00) WEDNESDAY is a WORKING day (05:00-21:00) THURSDAY is a WORKING day (05:00-21:00) FRIDAY is a WORKING day (05:00-21:00) SATURDAY is a WORKING day (09:00-17:00) To see the effect that our new working week has had on the calendar, let's first take a look at the week running up to the start of our crunch period. Using the same code we worked with previously to present working hours for a range of dates we see this output: 24/09/2022 0.0h 25/09/2022 0.0h 26/09/2022 8.0h 27/09/2022 8.0h 28/09/2022 8.0h 29/09/2022 8.0h 30/09/2022 8.0h So starting from Saturday 24th we can see that we have that standard working pattern: weekends are non-working (zero working hours), and week days have 8 hours of working time. Now let's look at the first week of our crunch period: 01/10/2022 8.0h 02/10/2022 8.0h 03/10/2022 16.0h 04/10/2022 16.0h 05/10/2022 16.0h 06/10/2022 16.0h 07/10/2022 16.0h We can see that the crunch is in full effect, we're working 8 hour days at the weekend, and 16 hour days for the rest of the week - not something I'd like to try for any length of time! To summarise: the ProjectCalendar instance itself defines the default working and non-working pattern for the seven week days. Additional working weeks can be added to the calendar which override this pattern for specific date ranges. Recurring Exceptions So far we've seen how exceptions can be used to override the default working pattern established by a calendar for either a single day, or for a contiguous range of days. We've also seen how an entirely new seven-day working pattern can be applied across a range of dates by using working weeks. But what if we want to represent a regularly occurring exception which will change our default working pattern such as, for example, Christmas Day or Thanksgiving? To deal with this we can use recurring exceptions. A recurring exception can be created simply by passing an instance of RecurringData to the addCalendarException method. RecurringData recurringData = new RecurringData (); exception = calendar . addCalendarException ( recurringData ); Let's create a simple recurence for 1st January for five years: recurringData . setRecurrenceType ( RecurrenceType . YEARLY ); recurringData . setOccurrences ( 5 ); recurringData . setDayNumber ( Integer . valueOf ( 1 )); recurringData . setMonthNumber ( Integer . valueOf ( 1 )); recurringData . setStartDate ( df . parse ( \"01/01/2023\" )); System . out . println ( recurringData ); The toString method on the RecurringData class tries to describe the recurrence as best it can, here's the output we'll see from the code above: [RecurringData Yearly on the 1 January From Sun Jan 01 00:00:00 GMT 2023 For 5 occurrences] The example above shows a very simple configuration. Full details of how to use RecurringData are provided elsewhere as they are beyond the scope of this section. Before we move on from recurring exceptions, one useful feature of the ProjectCalendarException class is the getExpandedExceptions method. This will convert a recurring exception into a list of individual exceptions representing each date or range of dates the recurring exception will affect the calendar. You may find this useful if you need to display or pass this data on for consumption elsewhere. Calendar Hierarchies Now we've seen how to set up an individual calendar, perhaps we could go ahead and create calendars for all of the people who will be working on our project? What we'd quickly find is that a considerable amount of the information in each calendar will be the same: the same working week pattern, the same public holidays and so on. We could set all of this up programmatically of course, but wouldn't it be great if we could change this kind of detail in just one place, and have all of our other calendars inherit it? Creating a Calendar Hierarchy As it happens, we can do this as our calendars can be organised into a hierarchy, with each \"child\" calendar inheriting its configuration from a \"parent\" calendar and overriding that configuration as required rather like a class hierarchy in a programing language). This will allow us to have one shared \"base\" calendar for everyone, with derived calendars used for individuals on our team where we need to add variation, for example personal vacation time and so on. ProjectFile file = new ProjectFile (); ProjectCalendar parentCalendar = file . addDefaultBaseCalendar (); Date christmasDay = df . parse ( \"25/12/2023\" ); parentCalendar . addCalendarException ( christmasDay ); In the example above we've used the familiar addDefaultBaseCalendar method to create a simple calendar, and called addCalendarException to add an exception for Christmas Day 2023. ProjectCalendar childCalendar = file . addDefaultDerivedCalendar (); childCalendar . setParent ( parentCalendar ); System . out . println ( christmasDay + \" is a working day: \" + childCalendar . isWorkingDate ( christmasDay )); Now we've created childCalendar , using a method we've not seen before, addDefaultBaseCalendar (we'll talk about this method in more detail in a minute), and we've used the new calendar's setParent method to attach parentCalendar as its parent. We can see the effect of this when we check to see if Christmas Day 2023 is a working day. This is a Monday so by default it will be a working day, but as childCalendar is inheriting from parentCalendar it picks up the exception defined in parentCalendar and makes Christmas Day a non-working day. Here's the output when our code is executed: Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 GMT 2023 is a working day: false We can also do the same thing with day types: parentCalendar . setCalendarDayType ( Day . TUESDAY , DayType . NON_WORKING ); System . out . println ( \"Is \" + Day . TUESDAY + \" a working day: \" + childCalendar . isWorkingDay ( Day . TUESDAY )); In the example above we've set Tuesday to be a non-working day in the parent calendar, and we can see that this is inherited by the child calendar. Here's the output we see when we execute our code: Is TUESDAY a working day: false So what's special about the \"derived calendar\" we've just created ( childCalendar ), why is it different to the normal calendar, and what's the difference between the addDefaultBaseCalendar and addDefaultDerivedCalendar methods? The answer to this question lies in the DayType enumeration. Let's take a look at the day types for parentCalendar . SUNDAY is a NON_WORKING day MONDAY is a WORKING day TUESDAY is a NON_WORKING day WEDNESDAY is a WORKING day THURSDAY is a WORKING day FRIDAY is a WORKING day SATURDAY is a NON_WORKING day So far so good, we have a mixture of working an non-working days, and we can see that as part of our last example we set Tuesday to be a non-working day. Now let's take a look at childCalendar : SUNDAY is a DEFAULT day MONDAY is a DEFAULT day TUESDAY is a DEFAULT day WEDNESDAY is a DEFAULT day THURSDAY is a DEFAULT day FRIDAY is a DEFAULT day SATURDAY is a DEFAULT day Ah-ha! Here we can see that the DayType enumeration actually has a third value alongside WORKING and NON_WORKING : DEFAULT . The DEFAULT value simply means that we should inherit the parent calendar's settings for this particular day: so whether the day is working, non-working, what the working hours are, and so on. We can override the day type we're inheriting from the base calendar: childCalendar . setCalendarDayType ( Day . TUESDAY , DayType . WORKING ); Date startTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 9 , 0 ); Date finishTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 12 , 30 ); childCalendar . addCalendarHours ( Day . TUESDAY ). add ( new DateRange ( startTime , finishTime )); In the code above we're explicitly setting Tuesday to be a working day, rather than inheriting the settings for Tuesday from the parent calendar, then we're adding the working hours we want for Tuesday. Earlier we said we come back and look at the addDefaultDerivedCalendar method in a little more detail. The main difference between addDefaultDerivedCalendar and addDefaultBaseCalendar is that the calendar created by addDefaultDerivedCalendar has no working hours defined, and all day types are set to DEFAULT so everything is inherited from the parent calendar. Working with a Calendar Hierarchy In general when working with a calendar hierarchy, if we use a calendar to determine working/non-working time, working hours, and so on for a given date, anything configured in a child calendar will always override what we find in the parent calendar. So for example if we have exceptions or working weeks configured in a child calendar, these will override anything found in a parent calendar. If we're asking the calendar a question about a particular day (rather than a date), for example Monday, Tuesday and so on, we'll use information from the child calendar if the day type is WORKING or NON_WORKING , otherwise we'll work our way up the calendar hierarchy until we find the first ancestor calendar which does not specify the day type as DEFAULT , and we'll use the configuration for the day in question from that calendar. This brings us on to an interesting question: how do we know if we ask the calendar for a piece of information, whether that's come from the calendar whose method we've just called, or if the response we've received has come from another calendar somewhere further up the calendar hierarchy? As it happens there are only a small number of attributes for which this is relevant. These are summarised by the table below. Attribute Set Get Get with Hierarchy Day Type setCalendarDayType getCalendarDayType getDayType Hours addCalendarHours getCalendarHours getHours Minutes Per Day setCalendarMinutesPerDay getCalendarMinutesPerDay getMinutesPerDay Minutes Per Week setCalendarMinutesPerWeek getCalendarMinutesPerWeek getMinutesPerWeek Minutes Per Month setCalendarMinutesPerMonth getCalendarMinutesPerMonth getMinutesPerWeek Minutes Per Year setCalendarMinutesPerYear getCalendarMinutesPerYear getMinutesPerYear The first column give us the name of the attribute, and the second column give the name of the method we'd call to set that attribute for the current calendar. The third column gives us the name of the method we'd use to retrieve the attribute from the current calendar only (i.e this will ignore any parent calendars). Finally the last column gives us the name of the method we'd call to retrieve the attribute from the current calendar, or inherit that attribute from a parent calendar if it is not present in the current calendar. We haven't looked at the Minutes Per X attributes so far. The values they contain are used when calculating working time. One interesting point to note is that if no calendars in a hierarchy define these values the default values will be retrieved from from the ProjectFile configuration, which is represented by the ProjectConfig class. How deep is your Hierarchy? MPXJ will allow you to create an arbitrarily deep hierarchy of calendars if you wish by establishing parent-child relationships between the calendars you create. Most schedule application file formats will only support a limited hierarchy of calendars, which you will see when you read files of this type when using MPXJ. The notes below briefly outlines how calendar hierarchies operate in some of the applications MPXJ can work with. If you are using MPXJ to create or modify schedule data, when you write the results to a file MPXJ will attempt to ensure that the calendars it writes to the file format you have chosen reflect what the target application is expecting. This means that MPXJ may end up \"flattening\" or otherwise simplifying a set of calendars and their hierarchy to ensure that they are read correctly by the target application and are \"functionally equivalent\" in use. Microsoft Project Microsoft Project uses two tiers of calendars. The first tier of calendars are referred to as \"base calendars\", one of which is marked as the default calendar for the project. Work is scheduled based on the default calendar, unless a task explicitly selects a different base calendar to use when being scheduled, or resources with their own calendars have been assigned to the task. Each resource will have its own calendar, which is always derived from a base calendar. Note that, as you might expect, material resources don't have a calendar! Primavera P6 The situation with P6 is a little more complicated, although it's still a two tier arrangement. P6 has the concept of Global calendars (broadly similar to base calendars in Microsoft Project). These can be assigned to activities in any project. Global calendars are never derived from other calendars. You can also have Project calendars which, as their name suggests, can only be assigned to activities in the project to which they belong. Project calendars can be derived from a Global Calendar, or they can have no parent calendar. Finally you can have two types of resource calendar: Shared, or Personal. These can either be derived from a Global calendar, or can have no parent. A Shared resource calendar can be assigned to multiple resources, but a Personal resource calendar can only be assigned to a single resource. When reading a P6 schedule, the ProjectCalendar method getType can be used to retrieve the calendar type (Global, Shared, or Personal), while the getPersonal method returns a Boolean flag indicating if the calendar is a Personal resource calendar. Others ConceptDraw, Planner, SureTrak and TurboProject all support some form of calendar hierarchy, although Planner is the only one which definitely supports an arbitrarily deep nested calendar structure. Calendar Container So far we've looked at creating and configuring calendars, and lining them together in a hierarchy. If we've just read a schedule in from a file, how can we examine the calendars it contains? Let's set up some calendars and take a look: ProjectFile file = new ProjectFile (); ProjectCalendar calendar1 = file . addCalendar (); calendar1 . setName ( \"Calendar 1\" ); ProjectCalendar calendar2 = file . addCalendar (); calendar2 . setName ( \"Calendar 2\" ); ProjectCalendar calendar3 = file . addCalendar (); calendar2 . setName ( \"Calendar 3\" ); Our sample code above creates three calendars, each with a distinct name. To see what calendars our file contains we can use the ProjectFile method getCalendars : file . getCalendars (). forEach ( c -> System . out . println ( c . getName ())); Which gives us the following output, as we'd expect: Calendar 1 Calendar 2 Calendar 3 The getCalendars method returns an object which implements the List<ProjectCalendar> interface, but it also does more for us than just that. The actual object being returned is a ProjectCalendarContainer , which is in charge of managing the calendars in the file and making it easy to access them. The typical way this is done is through the use of the calendar's Unique ID attribute. Each calendar has an Integer Unique ID, typically this is read as part of the calendar information from a schedule file, or if you are creating a schedule yourself, the default is for the Unique ID to be automatically populated. Let's see: file . getCalendars (). forEach ( c -> System . out . println ( c . getName () + \" (Unique ID: \" + c . getUniqueID () + \")\" )); Here's what we get: Calendar 1 (Unique ID: 1) Calendar 2 (Unique ID: 2) Calendar 3 (Unique ID: 3) Let's use a Unique ID to retrieve a calendar: ProjectCalendar calendar = file . getCalendars (). getByUniqueID ( 2 ); System . out . println ( calendar . getName ()); Here's the result of running this code: Calendar 2 The ProjectCalendarContainer class also allows us to retrieve calendars by name, although that's not recommended as MPXJ doesn't enforce presence or uniqueness constraints on calendar names. Most of the time accessing a calendar from some other part of MPXJ is handled for you, for example to retrieve a resource's calendar you just need to call the Resource method getCalendar rather than having to use ProjectCalendarContainer to retrieve it by Unique ID. Calendar Relationships The ProjectCalendar class provides a variety of methods to allow us to explore how it relates to other calendars and the rest of the schedule. As we've been discussing the hierarchy of calendars, the first method we can try is isDerived , which will return true if this calendar has been derived from a parent calendar. Alongside this we can also use the getParent method to retrieve this calendar's parent. We can traverse a hierarchy of calendars using this method until getParent returns null at which point we know we have reached a \"base\" calendar and can go no further. Calendars can also be assigned to both Tasks and Resources. The getTasks and getResources methods will each retrieve a list of the tasks and resources which explicitly use this calendar. Finally, earlier in this section we mentioned the idea of the default calendar for a project. We can set or retrieve the default calendar using the ProjectFile methods setDefaultCalendar and getDefaultCalendar , as illustrated below. ProjectFile file = new ProjectFile (); ProjectCalendar calendar = file . addDefaultBaseCalendar (); file . setDefaultCalendar ( calendar ); System . out . println ( \"The default calendar name is \" + file . getDefaultCalendar (). getName ()); As the name suggests, the default calendar will be used for all date, time, duration and work calculations if no other calendar has been assigned explicitly.","title":"Calendars"},{"location":"howto-use-calendars/#how-to-use-calendars","text":"Calendars are the foundation on which schedules are built.

First let's try creating one. As it happens, the ProjectFile class provides a convenience method addDefaultBaseCalendar to create a default calendar. The calendar it creates is modelled on the Standard calendar you'd see in Microsoft Project if you created a new project. This default calendar defines Monday to Friday as working days, with 8 working hours each day (8am to noon, then 1pm to 5pm). ProjectFile file = new ProjectFile (); ProjectCalendar calendar = file . addDefaultBaseCalendar (); System . out . println ( \"The calendar name is \" + calendar . getName ()); As you can see from the code above, the calendar also has a name which we can set to distinguish between different calendars.","title":"Calendars in MPXJ"},{"location":"howto-use-calendars/#working-days","text":"Let's see what the calendar can tell us.

Let's make Saturday a working day for our team, and make Monday a non-working day to compensate. calendar . setWorkingDay ( Day . SATURDAY , true ); calendar . setWorkingDay ( Day . MONDAY , false ); Now if we use the loop we saw previously to inspect the week days, we'll see this output: SUNDAY is a NON_WORKING day MONDAY is a NON_WORKING day TUESDAY is a WORKING day WEDNESDAY is a WORKING day THURSDAY is a WORKING day FRIDAY is a WORKING day SATURDAY is a WORKING day","title":"Working Days"},{"location":"howto-use-calendars/#working-hours","text":"So far, all we have done is set a flag which tells us whether a day is working or non-working. How do we know the working times on those days? We can use the getCalendarHours method to find that information. The getCalendarHours method returns a List of DateRange instances. DateRange is a simple immutable class which represents a span of time between a start date and an end date as an inclusive range. Let's try printing these DateRange instances to our output to see what we get: List < DateRange > hours = calendar . getCalendarHours ( Day . TUESDAY ); hours . forEach ( System . out :: println ); Here's the output: [DateRange start=Sat Jan 01 08:00:00 GMT 1 end=Sat Jan 01 12:00:00 GMT 1] [DateRange start=Sat Jan 01 13:00:00 GMT 1 end=Sat Jan 01 17:00:00 GMT 1] This isn't quite what we were expecting! What's happening here is that DateRange is using java.util.Date values to represent the start and end of the range, and the toString method of the dateRange class is just using these values directly. As these java.util.Date represent a full timestamp, we're seeing the entire timestamp here in our output. The day, month and year components of the timestamp have been set to a default value (in this case January 1st 0001). As work on MPXJ started in 2002, java.util.Date was the logical choice for representing dates, times and timestamps. Since Java 1.8, LocalTime would probably be a better representation for these values. This is likely to be a future enhancement to MPXJ. Let's add a method to format the hours of a day tidily for display: private String formatDateRanges ( List < DateRange > hours ) { DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat ( \"HH:mm\" ); return hours . stream () . map ( h -> df . format ( h . getStart ()) + \"-\" + df . format ( h . getEnd ())) . collect ( Collectors . joining ( \", \" )); } In a real application we probably wouldn't want to instantiate a new DateFormat each time we call the method, but this is fine as a demonstration. So now our output looks like this: 08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00 Let's use this method to take a look at the whole week again: for ( Day day : Day . values ()) { String dayType = calendar . getCalendarDayType ( day ). toString (); System . out . println ( day + \" is a \" + dayType + \" day (\" + formatDateRanges ( calendar . getCalendarHours ( day )) + \")\" ); } Here's the output: SUNDAY is a NON_WORKING day () MONDAY is a NON_WORKING day () TUESDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) WEDNESDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) THURSDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) FRIDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) SATURDAY is a WORKING day () The one thing we're missing now is that although we have set Saturday to be a working day, it doesn't have any working hours. MPXJ has some constants which can be used to help us add some working hours: hours = calendar . getCalendarHours ( Day . SATURDAY ); hours . add ( ProjectCalendarDays . DEFAULT_WORKING_MORNING ); hours . add ( ProjectCalendarDays . DEFAULT_WORKING_AFTERNOON ); Now when we examine our week this is what we see: SUNDAY is a NON_WORKING day () MONDAY is a NON_WORKING day () TUESDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) WEDNESDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) THURSDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) FRIDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) SATURDAY is a WORKING day (08:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00) The version of MPXJ at the time of writing (10.5.0) has a limitation that if setCalendarDayType is used to make a day into a working day, we don't automatically add working hours for it. This behaviour is likely to change with the next major version of MPXJ. What if we want to supply some working hours different from the defaults we've used so far? To set our own working hours we just need to create as many DateRange instances as we need using a pair of Date instances for each one to represent the start and end times. The year, month and day components of each Date are ignored. Here's an example of using Java's Calendar class to set a new working time for Saturday: Calendar javaCalendar = Calendar . getInstance (); javaCalendar . set ( Calendar . HOUR_OF_DAY , 9 ); javaCalendar . set ( Calendar . MINUTE , 0 ); Date startTime = javaCalendar . getTime (); javaCalendar . set ( Calendar . HOUR_OF_DAY , 14 ); javaCalendar . set ( Calendar . MINUTE , 30 ); Date finishTime = javaCalendar . getTime (); hours = calendar . getCalendarHours ( Day . SATURDAY ); hours . clear (); hours . add ( new DateRange ( startTime , finishTime )); Now when we look at the working hours for Saturday, this is what we see: SATURDAY is a WORKING day (09:00-14:30) MPXJ actually provides a helper method to simplify this process, here's the equivalent code: startTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 9 , 0 ); finishTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 14 , 30 ); Now we've seen how we can create our own ranges of working time for a day, let's tackle a slightly more challenging case: dealing with midnight. Our first step is to take a look at the actual amount of working time we've set up on Saturday. To do this we call the getWork method, as shown below. Duration duration = calendar . getWork ( Day . SATURDAY , TimeUnit . HOURS ); System . out . println ( duration ); This getWork method determines the total amount of work on the given day, and returns this in the format we specify. In this case we've asked for hours, and we'll be receiving the result as a Duration object. Duration simply combines the duration amount with an instance of the TimeUnit enumeration so we always know the units of the duration amount. Running the code above give us this output: 5.5h As you can see, the toString method of Duration give us a nicely formatted result, complete with an abbreviation for the units. Let's try to change Saturday to be 24 hour working. First we'll configure a midnight to midnight date range: startTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 0 , 0 ); finishTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 0 , 0 ); hours . clear (); hours . add ( new DateRange ( startTime , finishTime )); System . out . println ( formatDateRanges ( calendar . getCalendarHours ( Day . SATURDAY ))); This looks reasonable: 00:00-00:00 Now let's see how much work this represents: duration = calendar . getWork ( Day . SATURDAY , TimeUnit . HOURS ); System . out . println ( duration ); 0.0h Oh dear, that's not what we're expecting! This is one of the \"gotchas\" of the way MPXJ works presently: if we want to use midnight at the end of a date range, we actually need to explicitly create a time which is \"+1 day\" from our start time. The code below shows how we can do this using Calendar . javaCalendar . set ( Calendar . HOUR_OF_DAY , 0 ); javaCalendar . set ( Calendar . MINUTE , 0 ); startTime = javaCalendar . getTime (); javaCalendar . add ( Calendar . DAY_OF_YEAR , 1 ); finishTime = javaCalendar . getTime (); hours . clear (); hours . add ( new DateRange ( startTime , finishTime )); System . out . println ( formatDateRanges ( calendar . getCalendarHours ( Day . SATURDAY ))); We still end up with a range which looks like this: 00:00-00:00 But crucially now if we re-run the duration calculation, we get: 24.0h So we have our 24 hours of work on Saturday!","title":"Working Hours"},{"location":"howto-use-calendars/#exceptions","text":"After working a few of these 24 hour days on Saturdays, we might be in need of a vacation! How can we add this to our calendar? So far we've been working with the Day class to make changes to days of the week, rather than any specific date. Now we'll need to work with a specific date, and add an \"exception\" for this date. The terminology here can be slightly confusing when coming from a programming background, but the term exception is often used by scheduling applications in the context of making ad-hoc adjustments to a calendar. DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat ( \"dd/MM/yyyy\" ); Date exceptionDate = df . parse ( \"10/05/2022\" ); boolean workingDate = calendar . isWorkingDate ( exceptionDate ); System . out . println ( df . format ( exceptionDate ) + \" is a \" + ( workingDate ? \"working\" : \"non-working\" ) + \" day\" ); In the code above we're creating a Date instance to represent the date we want to add an exception for. The code uses the isWorkingDate method to determine whether or not the given date is a working day. Before we add the exception, here's the output we get: 10/05/2022 is a working day Now we can create our exception. ProjectCalendarException exception = calendar . addCalendarException ( exceptionDate ); exception . setName ( \"A day off\" ); The code above illustrates adding an exception for a single day. The time component of the Date instance you pass in here is irrelevant, the exception is always effective from the beginning of the day to the end of the day. The code above also shows that optionally an exception can be named, this can make it easier to understand the purpose of each exception. Now if we re-run our code which displays whether our chosen date is a working day, this is what we see: 10/05/2022 is a non-working day We have successfully added an exception to turn this date into a day off! Perhaps we were being a little too generous in giving ourselves the entire day off, perhaps in this case we should make this a half day instead. To do that, we just need to add a time range to the exception: startTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 8 , 0 ); finishTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 12 , 0 ); exception . add ( new DateRange ( startTime , finishTime )); Now if we look at our chosen date, this is what we see: 10/05/2022 is a working day Let's take a closer look at what's happening on that day: System . out . println ( \"Working time on Tuesdays is normally \" + calendar . getWork ( Day . TUESDAY , TimeUnit . HOURS ) + \" but on \" + df . format ( exceptionDate ) + \" it is \" + calendar . getWork ( exceptionDate , TimeUnit . HOURS )); The code above shows how we use the getWork method which takes a Day as an argument to look at what the default working hours are on a Tuesday, then we use the getWork method which takes a Date instance as an argument to see what's happening on the specific Tuesday of our exception. Here's the output we get: Working time on Tuesdays is normally 8.0h but on 10/05/2022 it is 4.0h We can see the effect of adding a DateRange to our exception: we've gone from an exception which changes a working day into a non-working day to an exception which just changes the number of working hours in the day. This same approach can be used to change a date which falls on a day that's typically non-working (for example a Sunday) into a working day, just by adding an exception with some working hours. We can also use a single exception to affect a number of days. First let's write a little code to see the number of working hours over a range of days: Calendar start = Calendar . getInstance (); start . setTime ( df . parse ( \"23/05/2022\" )); Calendar end = Calendar . getInstance (); end . setTime ( df . parse ( \"28/05/2022\" )); for ( Date date = start . getTime (); start . before ( end ); start . add ( Calendar . DATE , 1 ), date = start . getTime ()) { System . out . println ( df . format ( date ) + \"\\t\" + calendar . getWork ( date , TimeUnit . HOURS )); } Running this code with our calendar as its stands produces this output for the example week we're using: 23/05/2022 0.0h 24/05/2022 8.0h 25/05/2022 8.0h 26/05/2022 8.0h 27/05/2022 8.0h Let's add an exception which covers Tuesday to Thursday that week (24th to 26th), and changes the working hours, so there are now only four hours of work per day (9am to 12pm): Date exceptionStartDate = df . parse ( \"24/05/2022\" ); Date exceptionEndDate = df . parse ( \"26/05/2022\" ); exception = calendar . addCalendarException ( exceptionStartDate , exceptionEndDate ); startTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 9 , 0 ); finishTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 13 , 0 ); exception . add ( new DateRange ( startTime , finishTime )); Here we can see that we're using a different version of the addCalendarException method which takes a start and an end date, rather that just a single date. Running our code again to print out the working hours for each day now gives us this output: 23/05/2022 0.0h 24/05/2022 4.0h 25/05/2022 4.0h 26/05/2022 4.0h 27/05/2022 8.0h As we can see, we've changed multiple days with this single exception.","title":"Exceptions"},{"location":"howto-use-calendars/#working-weeks","text":"So far we've looked at using ProjectCalendarException , which can make one change (add working hours, change working hours, or make days non-working) and apply that change to one day or a contiguous range of days. What if we want to make more complex changes to the working pattern of a calendar? Let's imagine that our project has a three week \"crunch\" period at the beginning of October where we will need to work 16 hour days, Monday through Friday, and 8 hour days at weekends. (I hope this is a fictional example and you'd don't have to work at such a high intensity in real life!). We could construct this work pattern using exceptions: we'd need six in total, one for each of the three sets of weekend days, and one for each of the three sets of week days. An alternative way to do this is to set up a new working week, using the ProjectCalendarWeek class. \"Working Week\" is perhaps a slightly misleading name, as a ProjectCalendarWeek can be set up for an arbitrary range of dates, from a few days to many weeks. What it represents is the pattern of working an non-working time over the seven days of a week, and this pattern is applied from the start to the end of the date range we configure. The ProjectCalendar we've been working with so far is actually already a form of working week (they share a common parent class). The main differences between the two are that a ProjectCalendarWeek allows us to specify the range of dates over which it is effective, and a ProjectCalendarWeek does not have exceptions: exceptions are only added to a ProjectCalendar . Here's how our example looks in code: calendar = file . addDefaultBaseCalendar (); ProjectCalendarWeek week = calendar . addWorkWeek (); week . setName ( \"Crunch Time!\" ); Date weekStart = df . parse ( \"01/10/2022\" ); Date weekEnd = df . parse ( \"21/10/2022\" ); week . setDateRange ( new DateRange ( weekStart , weekEnd )); Arrays . stream ( Day . values ()). forEach ( d -> week . setWorkingDay ( d , true )); For a fresh start, we'll create a new ProjectCalendar instance. With this we'll add a new working week definition and give it a name, to make it easily identifiable. Now we'll set the dates for which this work pattern is valid (in this case the first three weeks of October). Finally we mark every day as a working day. Next we can set up our weekend 9am to 5pm working pattern: startTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 9 , 0 ); finishTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 17 , 0 ); DateRange weekendHours = new DateRange ( startTime , finishTime ); Arrays . asList ( Day . SATURDAY , Day . SUNDAY ) . stream (). forEach ( d -> week . addCalendarHours ( d ). add ( weekendHours )); Finally we can set up our weekday 5am to 9pm pattern: startTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 5 , 0 ); finishTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 21 , 0 ); DateRange weekdayHours = new DateRange ( startTime , finishTime ); Arrays . asList ( Day . MONDAY , Day . TUESDAY , Day . WEDNESDAY , Day . THURSDAY , Day . FRIDAY ) . stream (). forEach ( d -> week . addCalendarHours ( d ). add ( weekdayHours )); As ProjectCalendar and ProjectCalendarWeek are both derived from the same parent class, we can use the same code we did previously to examine how our new ProjectCalendarWeek instance looks: SUNDAY is a WORKING day (09:00-17:00) MONDAY is a WORKING day (05:00-21:00) TUESDAY is a WORKING day (05:00-21:00) WEDNESDAY is a WORKING day (05:00-21:00) THURSDAY is a WORKING day (05:00-21:00) FRIDAY is a WORKING day (05:00-21:00) SATURDAY is a WORKING day (09:00-17:00) To see the effect that our new working week has had on the calendar, let's first take a look at the week running up to the start of our crunch period. Using the same code we worked with previously to present working hours for a range of dates we see this output: 24/09/2022 0.0h 25/09/2022 0.0h 26/09/2022 8.0h 27/09/2022 8.0h 28/09/2022 8.0h 29/09/2022 8.0h 30/09/2022 8.0h So starting from Saturday 24th we can see that we have that standard working pattern: weekends are non-working (zero working hours), and week days have 8 hours of working time. Now let's look at the first week of our crunch period: 01/10/2022 8.0h 02/10/2022 8.0h 03/10/2022 16.0h 04/10/2022 16.0h 05/10/2022 16.0h 06/10/2022 16.0h 07/10/2022 16.0h We can see that the crunch is in full effect, we're working 8 hour days at the weekend, and 16 hour days for the rest of the week - not something I'd like to try for any length of time! To summarise: the ProjectCalendar instance itself defines the default working and non-working pattern for the seven week days. Additional working weeks can be added to the calendar which override this pattern for specific date ranges.","title":"Working Weeks"},{"location":"howto-use-calendars/#recurring-exceptions","text":"So far we've seen how exceptions can be used to override the default working pattern established by a calendar for either a single day, or for a contiguous range of days. We've also seen how an entirely new seven-day working pattern can be applied across a range of dates by using working weeks. But what if we want to represent a regularly occurring exception which will change our default working pattern such as, for example, Christmas Day or Thanksgiving? To deal with this we can use recurring exceptions. A recurring exception can be created simply by passing an instance of RecurringData to the addCalendarException method. RecurringData recurringData = new RecurringData (); exception = calendar . addCalendarException ( recurringData ); Let's create a simple recurence for 1st January for five years: recurringData . setRecurrenceType ( RecurrenceType . YEARLY ); recurringData . setOccurrences ( 5 ); recurringData . setDayNumber ( Integer . valueOf ( 1 )); recurringData . setMonthNumber ( Integer . valueOf ( 1 )); recurringData . setStartDate ( df . parse ( \"01/01/2023\" )); System . out . println ( recurringData ); The toString method on the RecurringData class tries to describe the recurrence as best it can, here's the output we'll see from the code above: [RecurringData Yearly on the 1 January From Sun Jan 01 00:00:00 GMT 2023 For 5 occurrences] The example above shows a very simple configuration. Full details of how to use RecurringData are provided elsewhere as they are beyond the scope of this section. Before we move on from recurring exceptions, one useful feature of the ProjectCalendarException class is the getExpandedExceptions method. This will convert a recurring exception into a list of individual exceptions representing each date or range of dates the recurring exception will affect the calendar. You may find this useful if you need to display or pass this data on for consumption elsewhere.","title":"Recurring Exceptions"},{"location":"howto-use-calendars/#calendar-hierarchies","text":"Now we've seen how to set up an individual calendar, perhaps we could go ahead and create calendars for all of the people who will be working on our project? What we'd quickly find is that a considerable amount of the information in each calendar will be the same: the same working week pattern, the same public holidays and so on. We could set all of this up programmatically of course, but wouldn't it be great if we could change this kind of detail in just one place, and have all of our other calendars inherit it?","title":"Calendar Hierarchies"},{"location":"howto-use-calendars/#creating-a-calendar-hierarchy","text":"As it happens, we can do this as our calendars can be organised into a hierarchy, with each \"child\" calendar inheriting its configuration from a \"parent\" calendar and overriding that configuration as required rather like a class hierarchy in a programing language). This will allow us to have one shared \"base\" calendar for everyone, with derived calendars used for individuals on our team where we need to add variation, for example personal vacation time and so on. ProjectFile file = new ProjectFile (); ProjectCalendar parentCalendar = file . addDefaultBaseCalendar (); Date christmasDay = df . parse ( \"25/12/2023\" ); parentCalendar . addCalendarException ( christmasDay ); In the example above we've used the familiar addDefaultBaseCalendar method to create a simple calendar, and called addCalendarException to add an exception for Christmas Day 2023. ProjectCalendar childCalendar = file . addDefaultDerivedCalendar (); childCalendar . setParent ( parentCalendar ); System . out . println ( christmasDay + \" is a working day: \" + childCalendar . isWorkingDate ( christmasDay )); Now we've created childCalendar , using a method we've not seen before, addDefaultBaseCalendar (we'll talk about this method in more detail in a minute), and we've used the new calendar's setParent method to attach parentCalendar as its parent. We can see the effect of this when we check to see if Christmas Day 2023 is a working day. This is a Monday so by default it will be a working day, but as childCalendar is inheriting from parentCalendar it picks up the exception defined in parentCalendar and makes Christmas Day a non-working day. Here's the output when our code is executed: Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 GMT 2023 is a working day: false We can also do the same thing with day types: parentCalendar . setCalendarDayType ( Day . TUESDAY , DayType . NON_WORKING ); System . out . println ( \"Is \" + Day . TUESDAY + \" a working day: \" + childCalendar . isWorkingDay ( Day . TUESDAY )); In the example above we've set Tuesday to be a non-working day in the parent calendar, and we can see that this is inherited by the child calendar. Here's the output we see when we execute our code: Is TUESDAY a working day: false So what's special about the \"derived calendar\" we've just created ( childCalendar ), why is it different to the normal calendar, and what's the difference between the addDefaultBaseCalendar and addDefaultDerivedCalendar methods? The answer to this question lies in the DayType enumeration. Let's take a look at the day types for parentCalendar . SUNDAY is a NON_WORKING day MONDAY is a WORKING day TUESDAY is a NON_WORKING day WEDNESDAY is a WORKING day THURSDAY is a WORKING day FRIDAY is a WORKING day SATURDAY is a NON_WORKING day So far so good, we have a mixture of working an non-working days, and we can see that as part of our last example we set Tuesday to be a non-working day. Now let's take a look at childCalendar : SUNDAY is a DEFAULT day MONDAY is a DEFAULT day TUESDAY is a DEFAULT day WEDNESDAY is a DEFAULT day THURSDAY is a DEFAULT day FRIDAY is a DEFAULT day SATURDAY is a DEFAULT day Ah-ha! Here we can see that the DayType enumeration actually has a third value alongside WORKING and NON_WORKING : DEFAULT . The DEFAULT value simply means that we should inherit the parent calendar's settings for this particular day: so whether the day is working, non-working, what the working hours are, and so on. We can override the day type we're inheriting from the base calendar: childCalendar . setCalendarDayType ( Day . TUESDAY , DayType . WORKING ); Date startTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 9 , 0 ); Date finishTime = DateHelper . getTime ( 12 , 30 ); childCalendar . addCalendarHours ( Day . TUESDAY ). add ( new DateRange ( startTime , finishTime )); In the code above we're explicitly setting Tuesday to be a working day, rather than inheriting the settings for Tuesday from the parent calendar, then we're adding the working hours we want for Tuesday. Earlier we said we come back and look at the addDefaultDerivedCalendar method in a little more detail. The main difference between addDefaultDerivedCalendar and addDefaultBaseCalendar is that the calendar created by addDefaultDerivedCalendar has no working hours defined, and all day types are set to DEFAULT so everything is inherited from the parent calendar.","title":"Creating a Calendar Hierarchy"},{"location":"howto-use-calendars/#working-with-a-calendar-hierarchy","text":"In general when working with a calendar hierarchy, if we use a calendar to determine working/non-working time, working hours, and so on for a given date, anything configured in a child calendar will always override what we find in the parent calendar. So for example if we have exceptions or working weeks configured in a child calendar, these will override anything found in a parent calendar. If we're asking the calendar a question about a particular day (rather than a date), for example Monday, Tuesday and so on, we'll use information from the child calendar if the day type is WORKING or NON_WORKING , otherwise we'll work our way up the calendar hierarchy until we find the first ancestor calendar which does not specify the day type as DEFAULT , and we'll use the configuration for the day in question from that calendar. This brings us on to an interesting question: how do we know if we ask the calendar for a piece of information, whether that's come from the calendar whose method we've just called, or if the response we've received has come from another calendar somewhere further up the calendar hierarchy? As it happens there are only a small number of attributes for which this is relevant. These are summarised by the table below. Attribute Set Get Get with Hierarchy Day Type setCalendarDayType getCalendarDayType getDayType Hours addCalendarHours getCalendarHours getHours Minutes Per Day setCalendarMinutesPerDay getCalendarMinutesPerDay getMinutesPerDay Minutes Per Week setCalendarMinutesPerWeek getCalendarMinutesPerWeek getMinutesPerWeek Minutes Per Month setCalendarMinutesPerMonth getCalendarMinutesPerMonth getMinutesPerWeek Minutes Per Year setCalendarMinutesPerYear getCalendarMinutesPerYear getMinutesPerYear The first column give us the name of the attribute, and the second column give the name of the method we'd call to set that attribute for the current calendar. The third column gives us the name of the method we'd use to retrieve the attribute from the current calendar only (i.e this will ignore any parent calendars). Finally the last column gives us the name of the method we'd call to retrieve the attribute from the current calendar, or inherit that attribute from a parent calendar if it is not present in the current calendar. We haven't looked at the Minutes Per X attributes so far. The values they contain are used when calculating working time. One interesting point to note is that if no calendars in a hierarchy define these values the default values will be retrieved from from the ProjectFile configuration, which is represented by the ProjectConfig class.","title":"Working with a Calendar Hierarchy"},{"location":"howto-use-calendars/#how-deep-is-your-hierarchy","text":"MPXJ will allow you to create an arbitrarily deep hierarchy of calendars if you wish by establishing parent-child relationships between the calendars you create. Most schedule application file formats will only support a limited hierarchy of calendars, which you will see when you read files of this type when using MPXJ. The notes below briefly outlines how calendar hierarchies operate in some of the applications MPXJ can work with. If you are using MPXJ to create or modify schedule data, when you write the results to a file MPXJ will attempt to ensure that the calendars it writes to the file format you have chosen reflect what the target application is expecting. This means that MPXJ may end up \"flattening\" or otherwise simplifying a set of calendars and their hierarchy to ensure that they are read correctly by the target application and are \"functionally equivalent\" in use.","title":"How deep is your Hierarchy?"},{"location":"howto-use-calendars/#microsoft-project","text":"Microsoft Project uses two tiers of calendars.

Project calendars can be derived from a Global Calendar, or they can have no parent calendar. Finally you can have two types of resource calendar: Shared, or Personal. These can either be derived from a Global calendar, or can have no parent. A Shared resource calendar can be assigned to multiple resources, but a Personal resource calendar can only be assigned to a single resource.

If we've just read a schedule in from a file, how can we examine the calendars it contains? Let's set up some calendars and take a look: ProjectFile file = new ProjectFile (); ProjectCalendar calendar1 = file . addCalendar (); calendar1 . setName ( \"Calendar 1\" ); ProjectCalendar calendar2 = file . addCalendar (); calendar2 . setName ( \"Calendar 2\" ); ProjectCalendar calendar3 = file . addCalendar (); calendar2 . setName ( \"Calendar 3\" ); Our sample code above creates three calendars, each with a distinct name. To see what calendars our file contains we can use the ProjectFile method getCalendars : file . getCalendars (). forEach ( c -> System . out . println ( c . getName ())); Which gives us the following output, as we'd expect: Calendar 1 Calendar 2 Calendar 3 The getCalendars method returns an object which implements the List<ProjectCalendar> interface, but it also does more for us than just that. The actual object being returned is a ProjectCalendarContainer , which is in charge of managing the calendars in the file and making it easy to access them. The typical way this is done is through the use of the calendar's Unique ID attribute. Each calendar has an Integer Unique ID, typically this is read as part of the calendar information from a schedule file, or if you are creating a schedule yourself, the default is for the Unique ID to be automatically populated. Let's see: file . getCalendars (). forEach ( c -> System . out . println ( c . getName () + \" (Unique ID: \" + c . getUniqueID () + \")\" )); Here's what we get: Calendar 1 (Unique ID: 1) Calendar 2 (Unique ID: 2) Calendar 3 (Unique ID: 3) Let's use a Unique ID to retrieve a calendar: ProjectCalendar calendar = file . getCalendars (). getByUniqueID ( 2 ); System . out . println ( calendar . getName ()); Here's the result of running this code: Calendar 2 The ProjectCalendarContainer class also allows us to retrieve calendars by name, although that's not recommended as MPXJ doesn't enforce presence or uniqueness constraints on calendar names.

As we've been discussing the hierarchy of calendars, the first method we can try is isDerived , which will return true if this calendar has been derived from a parent calendar. Alongside this we can also use the getParent method to retrieve this calendar's parent. We can traverse a hierarchy of calendars using this method until getParent returns null at which point we know we have reached a \"base\" calendar and can go no further. Calendars can also be assigned to both Tasks and Resources. The getTasks and getResources methods will each retrieve a list of the tasks and resources which explicitly use this calendar. Finally, earlier in this section we mentioned the idea of the default calendar for a project. We can set or retrieve the default calendar using the ProjectFile methods setDefaultCalendar and getDefaultCalendar , as illustrated below. ProjectFile file = new ProjectFile (); ProjectCalendar calendar = file . addDefaultBaseCalendar (); file . setDefaultCalendar ( calendar ); System . out . println ( \"The default calendar name is \" + file . getDefaultCalendar (). getName ()); As the name suggests, the default calendar will be used for all date, time, duration and work calculations if no other calendar has been assigned explicitly.","title":"Calendar Relationships"},{"location":"howto-use-fields/","text":"How To: Use Fields Once you've read a schedule using MPXJ, and you have a ProjectFile instance with tasks, resources and resource assignments, how do you access the data represented by the fields provided by each of these entities? If you're creating or updating a schedule, how can you assign values to fields? This section explains the different approaches you can take in each of these cases. Setter and Getter Methods Let's start by creating a task we can use to demonstrate some of these approaches: ProjectFile file = new ProjectFile (); Task task = file . addTask (); When you already know exactly which field you need to access, you can work with the data these fields contain in a type-safe way by using the setter and getter methods provided by each class, for example: task . setName ( \"Task 1\" ); String name = task . getName (); System . out . println ( \"Task name: \" + name ); Here's the output from the sample code: Task name: Task 1 Here we can see that we are able to set the name of the task using a String , and when we call the getter method we'll be returned the name as a String . How about working with a field that has a type other than a String? DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat ( \"dd/MM/yyyy\" ); Date startDate = df . parse ( \"10/05/2022\" ); task . setStart ( startDate ); System . out . println ( \"Start date: \" + df . format ( task . getStart ())); Here's the output from the sample code: Start date: 10/05/2022 We're setting and retrieving the task's start date using a Date instance. For almost all of the fields supported by tasks, resources, and resource assignments you'll find a pair of getter and setter methods allowing you to access and modify the field with a convenient type safe interface. Field Enumerations What if we don't know ahead of time which fields we need to access? For example, what if our application allows users to chose which fields to display for each task? In this case we can use a data-driven approach to read and write fields, as shown in the example below. task = file . addTask (); task . set ( TaskField . NAME , \"Task 2\" ); name = ( String ) task . get ( TaskField . NAME ); System . out . println ( \"Task name: \" + name ); startDate = df . parse ( \"11/05/2022\" ); task . set ( TaskField . START , startDate ); System . out . println ( \"Start date: \" + df . format ( task . getStart ())); Here's the output from this sample code: Task name: Task 2 Start date: 11/05/2022 What are the TaskField values in the example above? TaskField is an enumeration representing all of the fields of a Task instance. This type of enumeration is not unique to tasks, there are four main enumerations available: ProjectField : fields available from ProjectProperties ResourceField : fields available from a Resource TaskField : fields available from a Task AssignmentField : fields available from a ResourceAssignment The ProjectProperties , Resource , Task and ResourceAssignment classes noted above actually all implement the FieldContainer interface. This is the interface that gives us the get and set methods we've seen in the examples above. FieldContainer also provides us with one more interesting method: getCachedValue . What is this, and why is it different to the get method? Let's take a step back and look at calculated values to understand where getCachedValue fits in. Calculated Fields Some of the fields available from each of these classes can actually contain a calculated value. For example: the Task field \"Start Variance\" represents the difference between the Baseline Start date and the Start date of a task. Some schedules may provide this value for us when we read the data they contain, others may not. If we don't have this value when we read our schedule data, but we do have a Baseline Start and Start date available to us, then we can perform the calculation ourselves to produce the Start Variance value. The example below illustrates this: // Set up the sample project ProjectFile file = new ProjectFile (); // We need at least a default calendar to calculate variance file . setDefaultCalendar ( file . addDefaultBaseCalendar ()); // Create tasks Task task1 = file . addTask (); Task task2 = file . addTask (); // Set up example dates DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat ( \"dd/MM/yyyy\" ); Date baselineStart = df . parse ( \"01/05/2022\" ); Date startDate = df . parse ( \"10/05/2022\" ); // Update task1 using methods task1 . setStart ( startDate ); task1 . setBaselineStart ( baselineStart ); // Update task2 using TaskField enumeration task2 . set ( TaskField . START , startDate ); task2 . set ( TaskField . BASELINE_START , baselineStart ); // Show the variance being retrieved by method and TaskField enumeration System . out . println ( \"Task 1\" ); System . out . println ( \"Start Variance from method: \" + task1 . getStartVariance ()); System . out . println ( \"Start Variance from get: \" + task1 . get ( TaskField . START_VARIANCE )); System . out . println (); System . out . println ( \"Task 2\" ); System . out . println ( \"Start Variance from method: \" + task2 . getStartVariance ()); System . out . println ( \"Start Variance from get: \" + task2 . get ( TaskField . START_VARIANCE )); Here's the output from running this code: Task 1 Start Variance from method: 6.0d Start Variance from get: 6.0d Task 2 Start Variance from method: 6.0d Start Variance from get: 6.0d Regardless of how we set up the data, both the getStartVariance method and the call to get(TaskField.START_VARIANCE) trigger the calculation and produce the expected Start Variance value. Rather than immediately discarding the Start Variance value we've just calculated, this value is cached as part of the data held by the task, and will be returned next time we use the getStartVariance method or we call get(TaskField.START_VARIANCE) . Cached Values The getCachedValue method allows us to retrieve a field without attempting to calculate a value . It's not a method you'd normally expect to use, but it's worth mentioning for completeness. Let's take a look at this using a new example: // Set up the sample project with a default calendar ProjectFile file = new ProjectFile (); file . setDefaultCalendar ( file . addDefaultBaseCalendar ()); // Set up example dates DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat ( \"dd/MM/yyyy\" ); Date baselineStart = df . parse ( \"01/05/2022\" ); Date startDate = df . parse ( \"10/05/2022\" ); // Create a task Task task = file . addTask (); task . setStart ( startDate ); task . setBaselineStart ( baselineStart ); System . out . println ( \"Start Variance using getCachedValue(): \" + task . getCachedValue ( TaskField . START_VARIANCE )); System . out . println ( \"Start Variance using get(): \" + task . get ( TaskField . START_VARIANCE )); System . out . println ( \"Start Variance using getCachedValue(): \" + task . getCachedValue ( TaskField . START_VARIANCE )); The output from this code is: Start Variance using getCachedValue(): null Start Variance using get(): 6.0d Start Variance using getCachedValue(): 6.0d What we can see happening here is that using the getCachedValue method initially returns null as the Start Variance is not present, and MPXJ doesn't attempt to calculate it. When we use the get method, MPXJ sees that it doesn't have a value for this field and knows how to calculate it, and returns the expected result. Finally if we use the getCachedValue method again, as we've now calculated this value and cached it, the method returns the Start Variance. In summary, getCachedValue will never attempt to calculate values for fields which are not already present. This can be useful if you want to read a schedule using MPXJ, but retrieve only the fields which were in the original schedule, not calculated or inferred by MPXJ. Indexed Fields So far we've seen how simple fields like Name and Start can be accessed and modified using both field-specific and generic methods. Many organizations rely on using general purpose fields like \"Text 1\" and \"Date 1\" to store information relevant to their schedules. If we look for methods like setText1 or setDate1 we won't find them, so how can we work with these fields? The answer is quite straightforward, for each of these \"indexed\" fields you'll find getter and setter methods which take an integer value, for example: task . setText ( 1 , \"This is Text 1\" ); String text1 = task . getText ( 1 ); System . out . println ( \"Text 1 is: \" + text1 ); If you're working with the generic get and set methods, the situation is more straightforward as each individual field has its own enumeration, as shown below: task . set ( TaskField . TEXT1 , \"This is also Text 1\" ); text1 = ( String ) task . get ( TaskField . TEXT1 ); System . out . println ( \"Text 1 is: \" + text1 ); For Task , Resource and ResourceAssignment the following indexed fields are available for use: Cost 1-10 Date 1-10 Duration 1-10 Flag 1-20 Finish 1-10 Number 1-20 Start 1-10 Text 1-30 Outline Code 1-10 ( Task and Resource only) Populated Fields So far we've touched on how to can read and write fields in examples where we are targeting specific fields. If we're reading a schedule whose contents are unknown to us, how can we tell which fields are actually populated? A typical use-case for this might be where we need to read a schedule, then present the user with the ability to select the columns they'd like to see in a tabular display of the schedule contents. If you look at the various enumerations which have mentioned previously in this section ( TaskField , ResourceField and so on) you can see that there are a large number of possible fields a user could choose from, so ideally we only want to show a user field which actually contain non-default values. To solve this problem we need to use the appropriate getPopulatedFields method for each of the entities we're interested in. ProjectFile file = new UniversalProjectReader (). read ( \"example.mpp\" ); Set < ProjectField > projectFields = file . getProjectProperties (). getPopulatedFields (); Set < TaskField > taskFields = file . getTasks (). getPopulatedFields (); Set < ResourceField > resourceFields = file . getResources (). getPopulatedFields (); Set < AssignmentField > assignmentFields = file . getResourceAssignments (). getPopulatedFields (); In the example above we're opening a sample file, then for each of the main classes which implement the FieldContainer interface, we'll query the container which holds those classes and call its getPopulatedFields method. In each case this will return a Set containing the enumeration values representing fields which have non-default values. FieldType Earlier in this section we noted that there were four main enumerations representing the fields which particular classes can contain. ProjectField ResourceField TaskField AssignmentField What I didn't mention earlier is that each of these enumerations inherits from a the FieldType interface which defines a common set of methods each of these enumerations must implement. The most interesting of these methods are: name() getName() getFieldTypeClass() getDataType() The name() method retrieves the name of the enumeration value exactly as it appears in the code. The getName() method returns a localized version of the name, suitable for display to end users (currently English is the default and only supported locale). The getFieldTypeClass() method returns a value from the FieldTypeClass enumeration which will help you to determine which class this FieldType belongs to. Finally the getDataType() method will return a value from the DataType enumeration which indicates the data type you will receive from the get method when accessing this field, and the type to pass to the set method when updating the field. Here's some example code to make this a little clearer: FieldType type = TaskField . START_VARIANCE ; System . out . println ( \"name(): \" + type . name ()); System . out . println ( \"getName(): \" + type . getName ()); System . out . println ( \"getFieldTypeClass(): \" + type . getFieldTypeClass ()); System . out . println ( \"getDataType():\" + type . getDataType ()); In this case we're using the Task Start Variance field as an example. Here's the output: name(): START_VARIANCE getName(): Start Variance getFieldTypeClass(): TASK getDataType(): DURATION Returning to our earlier example of how we might allow a user to select fields we will display, we can use the data type of the selected field to determine how we format the value for display. private String getStringValue ( FieldContainer container , FieldType type ) { Object value = container . get ( type ); if ( value == null ) { return \"\" ; } String result ; switch ( type . getDataType ()) { case CURRENCY : { result = new DecimalFormat ( \"\u00a30.00\" ). format (( Number ) value ); break ; } case DATE : { result = new SimpleDateFormat ( \"dd/MM/yyyy\" ). format (( Date ) value ); break ; } case BOOLEAN : { result = (( Boolean ) value ). booleanValue () ? \"Yes\" : \"No\" ; break ; } default : { result = value . toString (); break ; } } return result ; } The sample code above implements a generic method which can work with any class implementing the FieldContainer interface (for example, Task , Resource and so on). Given the particular field the user has asked us to display (passed in via the type argument), we retrieve the value from the container as an Object , then use the data type to decide how best to format the value for display. (This is obviously a contrived example - I wouldn't recommend creating new instances of DecimalFormat and SimpleDateFormat each time you need to format a value!) Custom Fields MPXJ uses the term \"custom fields\" to group together a couple of related concepts. For Microsoft Project, generally speaking each entity (Task, Resource , Resource Assignment and so on) has a fixed set of fields available for use. The general purpose \"indexed\" fields (for example, Text 1-10, Number 1-10 and so on) are available to be used as you wish to meet your own needs. Typically these can be customized by changing the label which is shown in Microsoft Project to identify this field to a meaningful reflecting its use. MPXJ refers to this as the field's alias. Along with simply renaming the field using an alias, there are a variety of other configuration options available allowing lookup tables to be created to make data entry for these fields easier, or constrain the values a user enters. Masks can also be applied to guide the accepted format of any data entered in the field. Other scheduling applications like P6 have the concept of User Defined Fields (UDFs) where the user has the ability to create entirely new fields, assign them a name and data type, and potentially provide other configuration like lookup tables. As noted elsewhere MPXJ follows Microsoft Project's model of using a fixed set of fields, so any UDFs defined in applications like P6 are mapped onto the available \"indexed\" fields. For example, the first text UDF a user defines for tasks in P6 might be mapped to the Text 1 field in MPXJ, the next text UDF a user defines might be Text 2 and so on. Now we've seen how MPXJ handles these fields, how can we use them? Information about custom field configurations can be obtained from the CustomFieldsContainer . The sample code below provides a simple illustration of how we can query this data. ProjectFile file = new UniversalProjectReader (). read ( \"example.mpp\" ); CustomFieldContainer container = file . getCustomFields (); for ( CustomField field : container ) { FieldType type = field . getFieldType (); String typeClass = type . getFieldTypeClass (). toString (); String typeName = type . name (); String alias = field . getAlias (); System . out . println ( typeClass + \".\" + typeName + \"\\t\" + alias ); } Depending on how your schedule is configured, you'll see output like this: TASK.TEXT1 Change Request Reason TASK.NUMBER1 Number of Widgets Required RESOURCE.DATE1 Significant Date In the source above, the first thing we're retrieving from each CustomField instance is the FieldType , which identifies the field we're configuring. The values we retrieve here will be from one of the enumerations we've touched on previously in this section, for example TaskField , ResourceField and so on. The next thing we're doing in our sample code is to create a representation of the parent type to which this field belongs, followed by the name of the field itself (this is what's providing us with the value TASK.TEXT1 for example). Finally we're displaying the alias which has been set by the user for this field. It's important to note that for schedules from Microsoft Project, there won't necessarily be a CustomField entry for the \"indexed fields\" in use in a schedule. For example, if a user has added values to the \"Text 1\" field for each of the tasks in their schedule, unless they have configured Text 1 in some way (for example by setting an alias or adding a lookup table) there won't be an entry in the CustomFieldContainer . As well as iterating through the collection of CustomField instances for the current schedule, you can directly request the CustomField instance for a specific field, as shown below: CustomField fieldConfiguration = container . get ( TaskField . TEXT1 ); One common use-case for the configuration data help in CustomFieldContainer is to locate particular information you are expecting to find in the schedule. For example, let's say that you know that the schedule you're reading should have a field on each task which users have named \"Number of Widgets Required\". You can determine which field contains this data using a method call similar to the one shown below: FieldType fieldType = container . getFieldTypeByAlias ( FieldTypeClass . TASK , \"Number of Widgets Required\" ); Note that the first argument we need to pass identifies which parent entity we're expecting to find the field in. The CustomFieldContainer will have entries from all field containers (tasks, resources, resource assignments and son on) so this is used to locate the correct one - particularly useful if, for example, a task and a resource might both have a field with the same alias! Remember: this method will return null if we don't have a field with the alias you've provided. Once we have the FieldType of the field we're looking for, we can use his to retrieve the value using the get method as we've seen earlier in this section: Task task = file . getTaskByID ( Integer . valueOf ( 1 )); Object value = task . get ( fieldType ); Finally, there are a couple of convenience methods to make retrieving a field by its alias easier. The first is that each \"container\" class for the various entities also provides a getFieldTypeByAlias method. If you know ahead of time you're looking for a field in a particular entity, this will simplify your code somewhat. The example below illustrates this: as we're looking for a task field we can go straight to the TaskContainer and ask for the field with the alias we're looking for: fieldType = file . getTasks (). getFieldTypeByAlias ( \"Number of Widgets Required\" ); Lastly, you can actually retrieve the value of a field directly from the parent entity using its alias, as shown below: value = task . getFieldByAlias ( \"Number of Widgets Required\" ); This is not recommended where you are iterating across multiple tasks to retrieve values: it's more efficient to look up the FieldType once before you start, then use that to retrieve the value you are interested in from each task.","title":"Fields"},{"location":"howto-use-fields/#how-to-use-fields","text":"Once you've read a schedule using MPXJ, and you have a ProjectFile instance with tasks, resources and resource assignments, how do you access the data represented by the fields provided by each of these entities?

This is the interface that gives us the get and set methods we've seen in the examples above. FieldContainer also provides us with one more interesting method: getCachedValue .

Let's take a step back and look at calculated values to understand where getCachedValue fits in.","title":"Field Enumerations"},{"location":"howto-use-fields/#calculated-fields","text":"Some of the fields available from each of these classes can actually contain a calculated value. For example: the Task field \"Start Variance\" represents the difference between the Baseline Start date and the Start date of a task. Some schedules may provide this value for us when we read the data they contain, others may not. If we don't have this value when we read our schedule data, but we do have a Baseline Start and Start date available to us, then we can perform the calculation ourselves to produce the Start Variance value. The example below illustrates this: // Set up the sample project ProjectFile file = new ProjectFile (); // We need at least a default calendar to calculate variance file . setDefaultCalendar ( file . addDefaultBaseCalendar ()); // Create tasks Task task1 = file . addTask (); Task task2 = file . addTask (); // Set up example dates DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat ( \"dd/MM/yyyy\" ); Date baselineStart = df . parse ( \"01/05/2022\" ); Date startDate = df . parse ( \"10/05/2022\" ); // Update task1 using methods task1 . setStart ( startDate ); task1 . setBaselineStart ( baselineStart ); // Update task2 using TaskField enumeration task2 . set ( TaskField .

It's not a method you'd normally expect to use, but it's worth mentioning for completeness.

When we use the get method, MPXJ sees that it doesn't have a value for this field and knows how to calculate it, and returns the expected result. Finally if we use the getCachedValue method again, as we've now calculated this value and cached it, the method returns the Start Variance. In summary, getCachedValue will never attempt to calculate values for fields which are not already present. This can be useful if you want to read a schedule using MPXJ, but retrieve only the fields which were in the original schedule, not calculated or inferred by MPXJ.","title":"Cached Values"},{"location":"howto-use-fields/#indexed-fields","text":"So far we've seen how simple fields like Name and Start can be accessed and modified using both field-specific and generic methods. Many organizations rely on using general purpose fields like \"Text 1\" and \"Date 1\" to store information relevant to their schedules. If we look for methods like setText1 or setDate1 we won't find them, so how can we work with these fields? The answer is quite straightforward, for each of these \"indexed\" fields you'll find getter and setter methods which take an integer value, for example: task . setText ( 1 , \"This is Text 1\" ); String text1 = task . getText ( 1 ); System . out . println ( \"Text 1 is: \" + text1 ); If you're working with the generic get and set methods, the situation is more straightforward as each individual field has its own enumeration, as shown below: task . set ( TaskField . TEXT1 , \"This is also Text 1\" ); text1 = ( String ) task . get ( TaskField . TEXT1 ); System . out . println ( \"Text 1 is: \" + text1 ); For Task , Resource and ResourceAssignment the following indexed fields are available for use: Cost 1-10 Date 1-10 Duration 1-10 Flag 1-20 Finish 1-10 Number 1-20 Start 1-10 Text 1-30 Outline Code 1-10 ( Task and Resource only)","title":"Indexed Fields"},{"location":"howto-use-fields/#populated-fields","text":"So far we've touched on how to can read and write fields in examples where we are targeting specific fields.

A typical use-case for this might be where we need to read a schedule, then present the user with the ability to select the columns they'd like to see in a tabular display of the schedule contents. If you look at the various enumerations which have mentioned previously in this section ( TaskField , ResourceField and so on) you can see that there are a large number of possible fields a user could choose from, so ideally we only want to show a user field which actually contain non-default values. To solve this problem we need to use the appropriate getPopulatedFields method for each of the entities we're interested in. ProjectFile file = new UniversalProjectReader (). read ( \"example.mpp\" ); Set < ProjectField > projectFields = file . getProjectProperties (). getPopulatedFields (); Set < TaskField > taskFields = file . getTasks (). getPopulatedFields (); Set < ResourceField > resourceFields = file . getResources (). getPopulatedFields (); Set < AssignmentField > assignmentFields = file . getResourceAssignments (). getPopulatedFields (); In the example above we're opening a sample file, then for each of the main classes which implement the FieldContainer interface, we'll query the container which holds those classes and call its getPopulatedFields method. In each case this will return a Set containing the enumeration values representing fields which have non-default values.","title":"Populated Fields"},{"location":"howto-use-fields/#fieldtype","text":"Earlier in this section we noted that there were four main enumerations representing the fields which particular classes can contain. ProjectField ResourceField TaskField AssignmentField What I didn't mention earlier is that each of these enumerations inherits from a the FieldType interface which defines a common set of methods each of these enumerations must implement. The most interesting of these methods are: name() getName() getFieldTypeClass() getDataType() The name() method retrieves the name of the enumeration value exactly as it appears in the code. The getName() method returns a localized version of the name, suitable for display to end users (currently English is the default and only supported locale). The getFieldTypeClass() method returns a value from the FieldTypeClass enumeration which will help you to determine which class this FieldType belongs to. Finally the getDataType() method will return a value from the DataType enumeration which indicates the data type you will receive from the get method when accessing this field, and the type to pass to the set method when updating the field. Here's some example code to make this a little clearer: FieldType type = TaskField . START_VARIANCE ; System . out . println ( \"name(): \" + type . name ()); System . out . println ( \"getName(): \" + type . getName ()); System . out . println ( \"getFieldTypeClass(): \" + type . getFieldTypeClass ()); System . out . println ( \"getDataType():\" + type . getDataType ()); In this case we're using the Task Start Variance field as an example. Here's the output: name(): START_VARIANCE getName(): Start Variance getFieldTypeClass(): TASK getDataType(): DURATION Returning to our earlier example of how we might allow a user to select fields we will display, we can use the data type of the selected field to determine how we format the value for display. private String getStringValue ( FieldContainer container , FieldType type ) { Object value = container . get ( type ); if ( value == null ) { return \"\" ; } String result ; switch ( type . getDataType ()) { case CURRENCY : { result = new DecimalFormat ( \"\u00a30.00\" ). format (( Number ) value ); break ; } case DATE : { result = new SimpleDateFormat ( \"dd/MM/yyyy\" ). format (( Date ) value ); break ; } case BOOLEAN : { result = (( Boolean ) value ). booleanValue () ? \"Yes\" : \"No\" ; break ; } default : { result = value . toString (); break ; } } return result ; } The sample code above implements a generic method which can work with any class implementing the FieldContainer interface (for example, Task , Resource and so on). Given the particular field the user has asked us to display (passed in via the type argument), we retrieve the value from the container as an Object , then use the data type to decide how best to format the value for display. (This is obviously a contrived example - I wouldn't recommend creating new instances of DecimalFormat and SimpleDateFormat each time you need to format a value!)","title":"FieldType"},{"location":"howto-use-fields/#custom-fields","text":"MPXJ uses the term \"custom fields\" to group together a couple of related concepts. For Microsoft Project, generally speaking each entity (Task, Resource , Resource Assignment and so on) has a fixed set of fields available for use. The general purpose \"indexed\" fields (for example, Text 1-10, Number 1-10 and so on) are available to be used as you wish to meet your own needs. Typically these can be customized by changing the label which is shown in Microsoft Project to identify this field to a meaningful reflecting its use. MPXJ refers to this as the field's alias. Along with simply renaming the field using an alias, there are a variety of other configuration options available allowing lookup tables to be created to make data entry for these fields easier, or constrain the values a user enters. Masks can also be applied to guide the accepted format of any data entered in the field. Other scheduling applications like P6 have the concept of User Defined Fields (UDFs) where the user has the ability to create entirely new fields, assign them a name and data type, and potentially provide other configuration like lookup tables. As noted elsewhere MPXJ follows Microsoft Project's model of using a fixed set of fields, so any UDFs defined in applications like P6 are mapped onto the available \"indexed\" fields. For example, the first text UDF a user defines for tasks in P6 might be mapped to the Text 1 field in MPXJ, the next text UDF a user defines might be Text 2 and so on. Now we've seen how MPXJ handles these fields, how can we use them? Information about custom field configurations can be obtained from the CustomFieldsContainer . The sample code below provides a simple illustration of how we can query this data. ProjectFile file = new UniversalProjectReader (). read ( \"example.mpp\" ); CustomFieldContainer container = file . getCustomFields (); for ( CustomField field : container ) { FieldType type = field . getFieldType (); String typeClass = type . getFieldTypeClass (). toString (); String typeName = type . name (); String alias = field . getAlias (); System . out . println ( typeClass + \".\" + typeName + \"\\t\" + alias ); } Depending on how your schedule is configured, you'll see output like this: TASK.TEXT1 Change Request Reason TASK.NUMBER1 Number of Widgets Required RESOURCE.DATE1 Significant Date In the source above, the first thing we're retrieving from each CustomField instance is the FieldType , which identifies the field we're configuring. The values we retrieve here will be from one of the enumerations we've touched on previously in this section, for example TaskField , ResourceField and so on. The next thing we're doing in our sample code is to create a representation of the parent type to which this field belongs, followed by the name of the field itself (this is what's providing us with the value TASK.TEXT1 for example). Finally we're displaying the alias which has been set by the user for this field. It's important to note that for schedules from Microsoft Project, there won't necessarily be a CustomField entry for the \"indexed fields\" in use in a schedule. For example, if a user has added values to the \"Text 1\" field for each of the tasks in their schedule, unless they have configured Text 1 in some way (for example by setting an alias or adding a lookup table) there won't be an entry in the CustomFieldContainer . As well as iterating through the collection of CustomField instances for the current schedule, you can directly request the CustomField instance for a specific field, as shown below: CustomField fieldConfiguration = container . get ( TaskField . TEXT1 ); One common use-case for the configuration data help in CustomFieldContainer is to locate particular information you are expecting to find in the schedule. For example, let's say that you know that the schedule you're reading should have a field on each task which users have named \"Number of Widgets Required\". You can determine which field contains this data using a method call similar to the one shown below: FieldType fieldType = container . getFieldTypeByAlias ( FieldTypeClass . TASK , \"Number of Widgets Required\" ); Note that the first argument we need to pass identifies which parent entity we're expecting to find the field in.

MPP: The MPP file format is Microsoft's proprietary way of storing project data. MPXJ supports read only access to MPP files produced by Microsoft Project 98, Microsoft Project 2000, Microsoft Project 2002, Microsoft Project 2003, Microsoft Project 2007, Microsoft Project 2010, Microsoft Project 2013, Microsoft Project 2016, and Microsoft Project 2019. MPP template files, with the suffix MPT are also supported. MSPDI: The MSPDI file format is Microsoft's XML file format for storing project data. Versions of Microsoft Project from 2002 onwards can read and write MSPDI files. MPXJ allows MSPDI files to be created, read, and written. The MSDPI file format has remained broadly unchanged since it was introduced, although several versions of Microsoft Project have tweaked the file format slightly, and have their own updated documentation. Documentation is available online here . Documentation for the Project 2003 MSPDI file format can be downloaded as part of the Office 2003 XML Reference Schemas package. Documentation for the Project 2007 MSPDI file format can be downloaded as part of the Project 2007 SDK . Documentation for the Project 2010 MSPDI file format can be downloaded as part of the Project 2010 Reference: Software Development Kit . Documentation for the Project 2013 MSPDI file format can be downloaded as part of the Project 2013 SDK . MPD: The MPD file format is an Access database used to store one or more projects. The database schema used in these databases is also close to that used by Microsoft Project Server. MPXJ can read projects stored in an MPD file using a JDBC connection. It is possible that MPXJ could also read the same data from a Microsoft Project Server database using the same approach, but this is not something I've tested. PLANNER: Planner is an Open Source project management tool which uses an XML file format to store project data. MPXJ can read and write the Planner file format. PRIMAVERA P6: Primavera P6 is an industry-leading tool favoured by users with complex planning requirements. It can export project data in the form of XER or PMXML files, both of which MPXJ can read. It is also possible for MPXJ to connect directly to the P6 database via JDBC to read project data. MPXJ can also write PMXML files to allow data to be exported in a form which can be consumed by P6. The PMXML schema forms part of the P6 distribution media, which can be downloaded from the Oracle e-Delivery site. PRIMAVERA P3: Primavera P3 (Primavera Project Planner) is the forerunner of P6. It holds projects in Btrieve database files which MPXJ can read from a directory or from a zip archive. MPXJ can also read P3 data from PRX backup files. PRIMAVERA SURETRAK: SureTrak holds projects in Btrieve database files which MPXJ can read from a directory or from a zip archive. MPXJ can also read SureTrak data from STX backup files. POWERPROJECT: Asta Powerproject is a planning tool used in a number of industries, particularly construction. Powerproject can save data to PP files or to MDB database files, and MPXJ can read both of these formats. PHOENIX: Phoenix Project Manager is an easy-to-use critical path method scheduling tool aimed primarily at the construction industry. Phoenix writes PPX files which MPXJ can read. FASTTRACK: Fasttrack Schedule is general purpose planning tool. FastTrack writes FTS files which MPXJ can read. GANTTPROJECT: GanttProject is an open source general purpose planning tool. GanttProject writes GAN files which MPXJ can read. TURBOPROJECT: TurboProject is general purpose planning tool. TurboProject writes PEP files which MPXJ can read. CONECPTDRAW PROJECT: ConceptDraw PROJECT is general purpose planning tool. ConceptDraw PROJECT writes CDPX, CDPZ and CDPTZ files which MPXJ can read. SYNCHRO SCHEDULER: Synchro Scheduler is general purpose planning tool. Synchro Scheduler writes SP files which MPXJ can read. GANTT DESIGNER: Gantt Designer is a simple Gantt chart drawing tool. Gantt Designer writes GNT files which MPXJ can read. SDEF: SDEF is the Standard Data Exchange Format, as defined by the USACE (United States Army Corps of Engineers). SDEF is a fixed column format text file, used to import a project schedule up into the QCS (Quality Control System) software from USACE. MPXJ can read and write SDEF files. The specification for the file format can be found here . SCHEDULE_GRID: Schedule grid files are produced when a schedule is exported from Sage 100 Contractor. MPXJ can read schedule grid files. PROJECT COMMANDER: Project Commander files are the native file format used by the Project Commander application. Project Commander writes PC files which MPXJ can read.","title":"File Formats"},{"location":"supported-formats/#supported-formats","text":"MPX: The MPX file format can be read by versions of Microsoft Project up to and including Microsoft Project 2010, and written by versions up to Microsoft Project 98.
