<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>


<p>Welcome to MPXJ! This library provides a set of facilities to
allow project information to be manipulated in Java and .Net. MPXJ supports
a range of data formats: Microsoft Project Exchange (MPX), Microsoft
Project (MPP, MPT), Microsoft Project Data Interchange (MSPDI XML), Microsoft 
Project Database (MPD), Planner (XML), Primavera P6 (PM XML, XER, and database), 
Primavera P3 (PRX and database), SureTrak (STX and database), 
Asta Powerproject and Easyplan (PP, MDB), Phoenix Project Manager (PPX),
FastTrack Schedule (FTS), GanttProject (GAN), TurboProject (PEP),
ConceptDraw PROJECT (CDPX, CPDZ and CPDTZ),
and the Standard Data Exchange Format (SDEF).</p>


<p>The library is currently based around a set of structures
modelled on the data described by the MPP file format. All
manipulation of project data takes place using these data
structures, which can be read from or written to the various
supported file formats. The notes in the following paragraphs explain the
facilities MPXJ offers for each file format.</p>


<ul>

<li><b>MPX:</b> The MPX file format can be read by versions of Microsoft
Project up to and including Microsoft project 2010, and written by all versions up to Microsoft Project 98.
MPXJ allows MPX files to be created, read and written. See
<a class="externalLink" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q270139" target="_blank">
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q270139</a> 
for a definition of the file format.</li>


<li><b>MPP:</b> The MPP file format is Microsoft's proprietary way of storing
project data. MPXJ supports read only access to MPP files produced
by Microsoft Project 98, Microsoft Project 2000, Microsoft 
Project 2002, Microsoft Project 2003, Microsoft Project 2007, Microsoft Project 2010, Microsoft Project 2013, and Microsoft Project 2016.
MPP template files, with the suffix MPT are also supported.</li>


<li><b>MSPDI:</b> The MSPDI file format is Microsoft's XML file format for
storing project data. Versions of Microsoft Project from 2002 onwards can read and write MSPDI files. 
MPXJ allows MSPDI files to be created, read, and written. Documentation for the 
Project 2003 MSPDI file format can be 
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=FE118952-3547-420A-A412-00A2662442D9" target="_blank">
downloaded from the MSDN web site</a> as part of the Office 2003 
XML Reference Schemas package. Documentation for the Project 2007 MSPDI
file format can be 
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=2672f6f9-7028-4b30-99a2-18cb1eed1abe" target="_blank">
downloaded from the MSDN web site</a> as part of the 
Microsoft Project 2007 SDK.
Documentation for the Project 2010 MSPDI file format can be 
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=46007f25-b44e-4aa6-80ff-9c0e75835ad9" target="_blank">downloaded from the MSDN web site</a>
as part of the Microsoft Project 2010 SDK. 
</li>


<li><b>MPD:</b> The MPD file format is an Access database file format used to
store one or more projects. The database schema used in these databases is 
also close to that used by Microsoft Project Server. MPXJ can read projects
stored in an MPD file using a JDBC connection. It is possible that MPXJ could 
also read the same data from a Microsoft Project Server database using the
same approach - but I haven't tried this!</li>


<li><b>PLANNER:</b> Planner is an Open Source project management too which uses
an XML file format to store project data. MPXJ read and write the Planner
file format.</li>


<li><b>PRIMAVERA P6:</b> Primavera P6 is a high end project planning tool favoured
by users with complex planning requirements. It can export project data in the 
form of an XER or PM XML files, both of which MPXJ can read. It is also possible for MPXJ to connect
directly to the Primavera database via JDBC to read project data. MPXJ can also write PM XML files 
to allow data to be exported in a form which can be consumed by Primavera.</li>


<li><b>PRIMAVERA P3:</b> Primavera P3 (Primavera Project Planner) is the forerunner of P6.
It holds projects in Btrieve database files which MPXJ can read from a directory or from a zip archive.
MPXJ can also read P3 data from PRX backup files.
</li>


<li><b>PRIMAVERA SURETRAK:</b> SureTrak holds projects in Btrieve database files which MPXJ can read from a directory or from a zip archive.
MPXJ can also read SureTrak data from STX backup files.
</li>


<li><b>POWERPROJECT:</b> Asta Powerproject is a planning tool used in a number of industries, 
particularly construction. Powerproject can save data to PP files or to MDB database files, 
and MPXJ can read both of these formats.</li>


<li><b>PHOENIX:</b> Phoenix Project Manager is an easy-to-use critical path method scheduling
tool aimed primarily at the construction industry. Phoenix writes PPX files which MPXJ can read.</li> 


<li><b>FASTTRACK:</b> Fastrack Schedule is general purpose planning tool. FastTrack writes FTS files
which MPXJ can read.</li> 


<li><b>GANTTPROJECT:</b> GanttProject is an open source general purpose planning tool. GanttProject writes GAN files
which MPXJ can read.</li> 


<li><b>TURBOPROJECT:</b> TurboProject is general purpose planning tool. TurboProject writes PEP files
which MPXJ can read.</li> 


<li><b>CONECPTDRAW PROJECT:</b> ConceptDraw PROJECT is general purpose planning tool. ConceptDraw PROJECT writes CDPX, CPDZ and CPDTZ files
which MPXJ can read.</li> 


<li><b>SDEF:</b> SDEF is the Standard Data Exchange Format, as defined by the USACE (United States
Army Corps of Engineers). SDEF is a fixed column format text file, used to import
a project schedule up into the QCS (Quality Control System) software from USACE.</li>

<h2><a name="Java_.Net_Ruby_PHP..."></a>Java, .Net, Ruby, PHP...</h2>

<p>MPXJ is written and maintained in Java, however this is no barrier to
using its functionality in .Net, Ruby, or PHP applications.</p>


<p>Thanks to the facilities 
provided by IKVM, the MPXJ distribution also contains a native .Net DLL version
of MPXJ and its library dependencies. This allows MPXJ to be used 
from any .Net programming language (for example, C#, Visual Basic 
and so on), without having to be aware that the original code was written 
in Java. As part of the MPXJ release process the Java and .Net libraries
are both exercised using the same set of regression tests to ensure that their
behaviour is identical. Both the Java and .Net versions of the library
are used in production commercial applications - so you can confident
that the code will work for you!</p>


<p>There is also now a <a class="externalLink" href="https://rubygems.org/gems/mpxj" target="_blank">Ruby gem</a>
which provides native Ruby access to data read using MPXJ</p>


<p>One option for working with the functionality offered by MPXJ in your
PHP application is to use a library like 
<a class="externalLink" href="http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net " target="_blank">PHP/Java Bridge</a>.
PHP/Java Bridge can be used to expose the complete MPXJ API in PHP: you don't
have to work in Java, C# or VB in order to work with Microsoft Project files.</p>

<p>The latest release of MPXJ can be downloaded from the project's
<a class="externalLink" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=70649">SourceForge download page</a>.
The core MPXJ functionality is contained in the mpxj.jar file, which you
will find in the root folder of the MPXJ distribution.
The library is simple to use, and to illustrate this, a
small number of sample files have been included in the utility
source package of the distribution.</p>


<p>The MPP functionality depends on the 
<a class="externalLink" href="http://poi.apache.org/" target="_blank">POI</a> library.
In order to use the MPP functionality in MPXJ, the
POI JAR file must be present on your classpath. A copy of this
library can be found in the lib directory of the MPXJ distribution.</p>
