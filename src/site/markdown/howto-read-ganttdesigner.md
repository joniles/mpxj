## How To: Read Gantt Designer files
Gantt Designer writes schedule data to GNT files.

### Reading GNT files
The simplest way to read a GNT file is to use the `UniversalProjectReader`:

```java
import net.sf.mpxj.ProjectFile;
import net.sf.mpxj.reader.UniversalProjectReader;

...

UniversalProjectReader reader = new UniversalProjectReader();
ProjectFile project = reader.read("my-sample.gnt");
```

You can work directly with the `GanttDesignerReader` by replacing `UniversalProjectReader` with `GanttDesignerReader`, although this offers no particular advantage as there are no additional configuration settings available on the `GanttDesignerReader` class.
