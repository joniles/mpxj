/**
 * This class has two purposes. The first is to ensure that JAXB sees the namespace
 * it is expecting when it reads the file, so we force our hard-coded namespace.
 * The second issue we deal with is that older versions of the PMXML file format
 * appear to be identical to the modern versions, except that the root element
 * is `BusinessObjects` rather than `APIBusinessObjects`. We use this class to
 * rename the element. Note that we try to be efficient about this, so we only
 * check the first start element, and ignore all other elements if it doesn't
 * need to be renamed.
