* Added support for reading the task attribute Subproject GUID from MPP files. This attribute can be accessed via the `getSubprojectGUID` and `setSubprojectGUID` methods.
* Added support for the task attribute "External Project". When this attribute is true it indicates that the task represents a subproject. The attribute is accessed via the `getExternalProject` and `setExternalProject` methods.
* When reading an MSPDI file with external task predecessors, MPXJ now attempts to recreate the placeholder external tasks which would be present if the equivalent MPP file was read.
* External task predecessors are now represented when writing an MSPDI file.
* Added the Task method `getSubprojectObject` which allows the caller to retrieve a ProjectFile instance representing the external project linked to a task.
* Added the Task method `expandSubproject`. For task which represent an external project, this method automatically loads the external project and attaches the tasks it contains as children of the current task. This is analogous to the behavior in Microsoft Project where a subproject is expanded to reveal the tasks it contains.
* Added the ProjectFile method `expandSubprojects` which identifies any tasks in the project which represent an external project and expands them, linking the tasks from the external project as children of the task in the parent project. Note that the method works recursively so multiple levels of external tasks will be expanded.

## 11.2.0 (2023-03-13)
* The project property Critical Slack Limit is now represented as a `Duration` rather than as an `Integer`. (Potentially breaking change if you were using this property directly).
* `TaskType` is now a simple enum with all Microsoft Project specific functionality moved into `TaskTypeHelper`. (Potentially breaking change if you were using the `TaskType` methods `getInstance` or `getValue` in your code)
* When reading the task type from P6 schedule the mapping to the MPXJ `TaskType` enum has been updated to more closely match P6. The main changes are that the P6 type "Fixed Units" now maps to `TaskType.FIXED_WORK` and the "Fixed Duration & Units" type now maps to a new enumeration value `TaskType.FIXED_DURATION_AND_UNITS`.

* When writing MSPDI files, UserDefinedField instances which were from applications other than Microsoft Project will automatically be mapped to available custom fields.
* When writing MPX files, UserDefinedField instances will automatically be mapped to available custom fields.
* The `UserDefinedField` type implements the `FieldType` interface and so can be used with the `FieldContainer` `get` and `set` methods to work with the contents of the user defined fields.
* The `ProjectFile.getUserDefinedFields()` method has been added to provide access to all user defined fields defined in the project.
* The `CustomFieldContainer` returned by `ProjectFile.getCustomFields()` will contain entries for all `UserDefinedField` instances.
* The various `getFieldTypeByAlias` and `getFieldByAlias` methods will retrieve user defined fields by name.

## 10.10.0 (2022-09-13)
* Add an option to import Phoenix schedules as a flat set of tasks with separate activity codes, rather than creating a hierarchy of tasks from the activity codes. Note the default is to disable this behavior so existing functionality is unchanged. (Contributed by Christopher John)
* Add a `setProperties` method to reader classes to allow configuration to be supplied via a `Properties` instance rather than having to call setter methods. Properties passed to the `UniversalProjectReader` version of this method will be forwarded to the reader class `UniversalProjectReader` chooses to reader the supplied file. Properties for multiple reader classes can be included in the `Properties` instance, each reader class will ignore irrelevant properties.
* Added the `get` method to `Task`, `Resource`, `ResourceAssignment` and `ProjectProperties` as a replacement for the `getCurrentValue` method. The new `get` method is paired with the existing `set` method to provide read and write access to attributes of these classes. This change is intended to improve the interfaces to these classes by making them more consistent, and thus easier to understand.
* Deprecated the `getCurrentValue` method on the `Task`, `Resource`, `ResourceAssignment` and `ProjectProperties` classes. Use the new `get` method instead.

* For P6 schedules, the `ResourceAssignment.getCostRateTable` method now takes in account any cost rate configuration details from the resource assignment when determining which table to return.
* A resource's Standard Rate, Overtime Rate and Cost per Use are now all derived from the resource's cost rate table, and not stored as attributes of the resource itself.
* The resource methods `setStandardRate`, `setOvertimeRate`, and `setCostPerUse` have been deprecated. These attributes can now only be set or updated by modifying the resource's cost rate table.
* When writing MPX files, only include attributes which have a non-empty, non-default value in at least one task or resource.
* When writing MPX files, ensure attributes which have calculated values are used.
* Add support for reading a resource assignment's rate type from P6 schedules. The rate type is accessed via the `ResourceAssignment.getRateIndex` method. The value returned by this method can be used to select the required rate using the `CostRateTableEntry,getRate` method.

* All five rates from each cost rate table entry can now be written to PMXML files.
* When reading files written by Microsoft Project, resource rate values now use the same units as seen by the end user rather than defaulting to hours as was the case previously. (For example, if the user sees $8/day in the source application, you will receive a Rate instance of $8/day rather than $1/hr).
* The values for a resource's standard rate, overtime rate, and cost per use attributes are now derived from the cost rate table. The values stored on the resource itself are only used if a cost rate table for the resource is not present.
* The Resource methods `getStandardRateUnits` and `getOvertimeRateUnits` are deprecated. Use the `getStandardRate` and `getOvertimeRate` methods to retrieve a `Rate` instance which will include the units for these rates.
* The Resource methods `setStandardRateUnits` and `setOvertimeRateUnits` are deprecated. Supply `Rate` instances to the `setStandardRate` and `setOvertimeRate` methods with the required units instead.
* The CostRateTableEntry methods `getStandardRateUnits` and `getOvertimeRateUnits` are deprecated. Use the `getStandardRate` and `getOvertimeRate` methods to retrieve a `Rate` instance which will include the units for these rates.

## 10.5.0 (2022-05-24)
* The `ProjectCalendarWeek` methods `addCalendarHours()`, `attachHoursToDay`, `removeHoursFromDay` have been removed. Use `addCalendarHours(day)`, `removeCalendarHours(day)` instead. (Note: this will be a breaking change if you were using the original methods to create or modify a schedule)
* The `ProjectCalendar` methods `attachHoursToDay` and `removeHoursFromDay` have been removed. Use the `addCalendarHours` and `removeCalendarHours` methods instead. (Note: this will be a breaking change if you were using the original methods to create or modify a schedule)
* The class hierarchy for `ProjectCalendarHours` and `ProjectCalendarException` has been simplified, but there should be no impact for uses of these classes.
* The `ProjectCalendarHours` class now implements the `List` interface. Methods in this class not part ofthe `List` interface have been deprecated in favour of the equivalent `List` methods.

* Add support for writing the calendar type and personal calendar flag to PMXML files.
* Updated the calendar class hierarchy: `ProjectCalendar` and `ProjectCalendarWeek` both now inherit from a new class `ProjectCalendarDays`. Note that `ProjectCalendar` is no longer a subclass of `ProjectCalendarWeek`.
* The `getHours` and `isWorkingDay` methods have been moved up to `ProjectCalendar` from the `ProjectCalendarWeek` class.
* The `ProjectCalendar` method `copy` has been deprecated, without replacement.
* Added a `getWork` method to `ProjectCalendar` which calculates the amount of work given a `Day` instance.
* Added `removeWorkWeek` and `removeCalendarException` methods to `ProjectCalendar`.
* Recurring exceptions are now added to a `ProjectCalendar` using the `addCalendarException` method which takes a `recurringData` instance its argument.

* Ensure that the user's selected progress period is used to set the project's status date attribute when reading Asta PP files.
* Ensure that a task's Complete Through attribute is not advanced to the start of the next working day (the behaviour of Microsoft Project prior to 2007 was to report Complete Through as the start of the next working day. This change ensures MPXJ matches versions of Microsoft Project from 2007 onwards. Previous behaviour can be restored using the ProjectConfig.setCompleteThroughIsNextWorkStart() method).
* Deprecate task getSplitCompleteDuration() and setSplitCompleteDuration() in favour of getCompleteThrough() and setCompleteThrough().

* Don't write Assignment Task GUID, Assignment Resource GUID or Resource Calendar GUID to JSON.
* Don't write a value for Assignment Work Contour to JSON if the contour is the default value (i.e. flat).

* Don't write zero rates to JSON files.
* Introduced a separator into rate values when written to a JSON file to make it clear that the value is a rate not a duration (for example: 5.00h is now 5.00/h).
* When writing an enum value of a JSON file, ensure we write the original enum name rather than the value return by toString. This provides more meaningful output (Potentially breaking change if you use the Ruby gem or consume the JSON output directly. Affected attributes are project properties: currency symbol position, time format, date format, bar text date format, schedule from, mpx file version; resource attribute: type).
* Ensure invalid cost rate table data is handled gracefully when reading from MSPDI files.
* Handle missing data when reading MSPDI files (based on a contribution by Lord Helmchen).

If you were previously using the "preserve note formatting" flag to retrieve the original formated version of a note, you will now need to use the getNotesObject method.
* Write WBS and Activity notes to PMXML files.
* PMXML compatibility improvements to ensure files can be successfully imported into P6.

## 8.4.0 (2020-12-29)
* Previously when reading PMXML files, XER files, and P6 databases, a set of baseline attributes on tasks and assignments (including Start, Finish, Duration, Cost and Work) were being populated with planned values rather than baseline values.
