This mrproject-0.6.xsd schema was generated from the original DTD.
The schema has been augmented to allow MPXJ to read a WBS attribute for a task, although Planner won't read files with this additional attribute.
The Planner file format is simple enough to make it useful as a way of constructing schedule data which can then be read by MPXJ.
The additional WBS attribute is intended to be used in that situation.
